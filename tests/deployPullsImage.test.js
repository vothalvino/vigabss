// InnoDB buffer pools, the kernel evicted cold pages into swap to make room;
// because the database is small those pages were never read again, so swap
// ratcheted up every deploy and never drained — until the machine thrashed
// hard enough to lock out SSH and need a reboot.
//
// These assertions are cheap and the failure they prevent is expensive and
// slow to diagnose (it presents as "the VPS gets stuck", days later, with no
// error attributable to the deploy that caused it).
