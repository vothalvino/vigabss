// VigaBSS 5.0 — TLS renewal configuration consistency
// =============================================================================
// A static guard over deployment config, because the failure it prevents is
// invisible for 90 days and then takes the site down, and there is no container
// to exercise in CI.
//
// History worth keeping, because it is the reason these assertions exist:
//
//   * The renewal loop ran `certbot renew --quiet` under
//     `restart: unless-stopped`. A failing renewal printed nothing, restarted
//     forever, and raised no alert — the first symptom was an expired
//     certificate served to every visitor. (#538)
//   * Cloudflare DNS-01 support existed for issuance but the renewal image had
//     no plugin and the credentials were deleted right after issuance, so those
//     certificates could be ISSUED but never RENEWED. (#540)
//   * That DNS-01 support was then removed entirely as unused. (2026-07-26)
//
// The provider-specific code is gone; the trap it fell into is not. If DNS-01
// is ever reintroduced, `certbot renew` reads the authenticator back out of
// /etc/letsencrypt/renewal/<domain>.conf and needs BOTH the matching plugin in
// the renewal image AND the credentials still present at the recorded path.
// The last test below enforces that pairing generically, for any provider.
// =============================================================================
