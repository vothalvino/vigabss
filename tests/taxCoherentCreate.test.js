// VigaBSS 5.0 — a new fiscal document may not contradict the resolved tax
// =============================================================================
// Two directions, both of which put a false statement in front of SAT on a
// document that cannot be un-sent:
//
//   * tax on an IVA-EXEMPT client — was already rejected on POST /invoices;
//   * NO tax when a rate applies — was NOT. `subtotal 100 / total 100` with no
//     tax fields infers tax_amount 0, satisfies both of the route's existing
//     invariants (tax matches rate, total matches subtotal + tax), and stamps
//     ObjetoImp=01 with no Impuestos node: a positive assertion to the tax
//     authority that the sale was not taxable.
//
// The guard REJECTS rather than rewriting. An operator who sent 1000.00 and got
// back an invoice for 1160.00 has been handed a document they never approved; a
// 422 is recoverable, a silently altered fiscal total is not.
//
// The hard part is not firing where it should not. It compares against
// resolveTaxContext instead of re-deriving locale rules, so a non-MX org — or an
// MX org that has deliberately configured 0% — is never blocked. Those cases
// are the bulk of what is asserted below, because a guard that breaks every
// non-Mexican deployment is worse than the bug.
