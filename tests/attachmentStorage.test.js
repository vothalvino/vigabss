// VigaBSS 5.0 — attachments are written where deployments actually mount
// =============================================================================
// Ticket attachments and work-order photos used to be written to
// `<repo>/uploads/...`, a directory NO deployment mounts. Everything else in
// the app writes under STORAGE_ROOT (`<repo>/storage`), which is mounted as
// `storage:/app/storage` in docker-compose.prod.yml and as the fireisp-storage
// PVC in k8s/deployment.yaml.
//
// Three distinct failures came out of that one wrong path:
//
//   * Docker — files lived in the container's writable layer, so every redeploy
//     silently destroyed every ticket attachment and technician job photo.
//   * Kubernetes — `readOnlyRootFilesystem: true` made the top-level mkdirSync
//     throw EROFS during require(), so the app did not fail to upload, it
//     failed to BOOT.
//   * Multi-replica — files were never shared between pods.
//
// The first is invisible until a redeploy and unrecoverable afterwards, which is
// why this file guards the shape of the fix and not just its behaviour.
// =============================================================================
