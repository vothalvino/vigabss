// VigaBSS 5.0 — mock transaction connection
// =============================================================================
// crudController's transactionalWrites path takes a real connection out of the
// pool (db.getConnection) and runs the fetch, the guard and the UPDATE on it.
// Suites mock db.getConnection as a bare jest.fn(), which resolves to undefined
// and then dies on conn.beginTransaction().
//
// This wires getConnection to a connection whose execute/query DELEGATE to the
// suite's existing db.query mock. That matters: it means every SQL dispatcher a
// suite has already written keeps working untouched, instead of each suite
// needing a second, parallel set of mock responses for the transactional path.
//
// The returned handle exposes the tx verbs so a test can assert them — chiefly
// that a guard which threw caused a rollback and never a commit.
// =============================================================================

// execute/query are jest.fn()s that FORWARD to db.query for their return value
// but record their own calls. That separation is load-bearing: if they were
// bare arrow functions, a statement run on the transaction and one run on the
// pool would land in the same db.query.mock.calls array, indistinguishable —
// and a test asserting "this ran inside the transaction" could not fail. Review
// of #584 found exactly that: a query left on db.query inside an open
// transaction (a nested pool acquire that can hang the process) was invisible
// to the suite. Assert on conn.execute, and on db.query NOT being called.
