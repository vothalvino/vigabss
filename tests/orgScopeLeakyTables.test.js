// src/models/BaseModel.js reads:

//     if (orgId !== null && this.hasOrgScope) { conditions.push('organization_id = ?') }
//
// so a model declaring `hasOrgScope = false` gets its org filter SILENTLY
// OMITTED rather than raising. No error, no log, no failing test — the defect is
// invisible by construction, which is why it survived. The same absent predicate
// flows into update/delete/restore, making it cross-tenant WRITE as well as read.
//
// device_config_backups and recurring_payment_profiles were both mounted behind
// a generic crudController over exactly such a model. The first holds full
// RouterOS exports (PPPoE/RADIUS secrets, SNMP communities, WireGuard keys); the
// second holds gateway tokens and Stripe customer ids.
//
// Migration 425 gave both an organization_id and the models now scope. These
// assertions pin the three things that have to stay true together — flip any one
// back and the hole reopens or the writes start landing unattributed.
