# ISP Management Software — Functions & Features Reference

> Comprehensive feature specification for an integrated ISP platform covering CRM, NMS, and Regulatory Compliance. Covers subscriber management, network operations, billing, and Mexican regulatory requirements (IFT/ATDT).

> ### Box legend — re-verified against code 2026-07-26
>
> This file is a **spec and industry reference**, not a to-do list. An unticked box does not
> automatically mean pending work, which is why the markers below now distinguish four cases.
> Of 48 unticked boxes found on 2026-07-26, only 11 were real engineering work.
>
> | Marker | Meaning |
> |---|---|
> | `- [x]` | Shipped. Where useful, the parenthetical cites the code that proves it. |
> | `- [ ]` | **Genuinely open work** — 12 remain. Five are queued as jobs (attachment data-loss, Aviso de Privacidad, config rollback, WhatsApp→AI, technician map); the other seven are acknowledged backlog, not yet scheduled: PayPal, NetFlow/sFlow classification, FTTH OLT drivers, map clustering, Zabbix/LibreNMS sync, poller sharding, CDN docs. |
> | `- ⊘` | **Never tickable.** Either a stack the spec *surveyed but VigaBSS did not choose* (Python/PHP, PostgreSQL), or an **operator action** — a legal/organizational step the software cannot perform (registering a licence, drafting terms with counsel). |
> | `- ◷` / `✅` | A performance **target to measure**, not build. `◷` = never measured; `✅` = measured and passing. |
>
> **Section numbers are cited by 58 files** (`-- Implements isp-platform-features.md §10.1 ...`
> across ~50 migrations, `schema.sql` and several services). Edit box states and annotations
> freely; **never renumber a section.**

## 21. AI-Powered Customer Support System

### 21.1 Overview & Philosophy
The AI support system acts as the **first line of customer contact** 24/7. Its goal is to resolve as many issues as possible without human intervention while ensuring a seamless handoff to a human agent when needed. The AI has **read-only and diagnostic access** to the entire platform (NMS for fiber and wireless, RADIUS, OLT, AP/sector monitoring, CRM, billing, TR-069) so it can give accurate, real-time answers for **both FTTH fiber and WISP wireless subscribers**.

**Core principle**: AI answers when it knows. Human answers when AI doesn't.

### 21.2 AI Query Routing Engine

Every incoming customer message (portal chat, WhatsApp, email, SMS, voice) goes through the routing engine:

```

   [HANDOFF TO HUMAN]
   (with full AI context summary)
```

#### Handoff Escalation Rules

### 21.4 AI Module — Technical Diagnostics & Troubleshooting

The AI tech diagnostic module works for **both FTTH (fiber) and WISP (wireless) subscribers**. The first thing it checks is the **subscriber's access type** (fiber/PPPoE vs. wireless/CPE-AP link) and runs the appropriate diagnostic branch.

**Data sources (FTTH fiber)**: SNMP NMS, RADIUS, OLT/ONU management, TR-069 ACS, alert database
**Data sources (WISP wireless)**: SNMP NMS, RADIUS, AP/sector monitoring (signal/SNR/CCQ), CPE status, wireless link metrics, alert database

---

#### 21.4a — Diagnostic: "My internet is slow" (FTTH Fiber)

1. Checks if subscriber's PPPoE session is active
2. Checks assigned speed profile vs. plan (mismatch?)
3. Reads recent speed test results from subscriber
4. Checks subscriber's ONU optical signal (Rx power within range?)
5. Checks if OLT PON port has alerts (degraded signal, high utilization)
6. Checks subscriber's router/CPE status via TR-069 (Wi-Fi channel congestion? firmware outdated?)
7. Checks if subscriber is hitting data cap / FUP threshold
8. Checks for active outages in subscriber's area
→ Returns diagnostic result with specific cause and fix, or escalates

#### 21.4b — Diagnostic: "My internet is slow" (WISP Wireless)

1. Checks if subscriber's PPPoE session is active (or DHCP session)
2. Checks assigned speed profile vs. plan (mismatch?)
3. Reads recent speed test results from subscriber
4. Checks which AP/sector the subscriber's CPE is connected to
5. Reads CPE signal strength, SNR, and CCQ/throughput from AP monitoring
6. Checks AP/sector load — how many clients on same AP? Is sector overloaded?
7. Checks for RF interference or channel congestion on that channel/frequency
8. Checks CPE alignment (if PTP: antenna alignment, Fresnel zone obstruction)
9. Checks CPE firmware version via TR-069
10. Checks if subscriber is hitting data cap / FUP threshold
11. Checks for weather conditions affecting wireless links (heavy rain on 5 GHz = rain fade)
→ Returns: "Your signal has dropped from -55 dBm to -72 dBm — tree/antenna misalignment likely." OR "Your sector has 48 active clients (capacity 50). Consider upgrading our Turbo plan." OR "CPE firmware is 2 versions behind; scheduling upgrade."

#### 21.4c — Diagnostic: "I have no internet" (FTTH Fiber)

1. Checks PPPoE session status (connected? authentication error?)
2. Checks ONU status (online? LOS? power-off?)
3. Checks OLT PON port (active? any alarms?)
4. Checks RADIUS authentication logs (rejected? bad password? expired?)
5. Checks account status (suspended due to non-payment?)
6. Checks for area-wide outage
→ Returns result: "Your ONU is offline (no light). Please check power cable." OR "Your account is suspended due to unpaid balance of $XXX. Pay now?" OR "There's an outage in your area, ETA 2 hours."

#### 21.4d — Diagnostic: "I have no internet" (WISP Wireless)

1. Checks PPPoE/DHCP session status
2. Checks RADIUS authentication logs (rejected? bad password? expired?)
3. Checks account status (suspended due to non-payment?)
4. Checks if subscriber's CPE is visible on any AP
5. If CPE not visible on any AP → CPE offline or misaligned
6. If CPE visible but no session → RADIUS or plan issue
7. Checks for AP/sector outage (AP down? sector down? backhaul link down?)
8. Checks weather alerts (storm = signal fade)
→ Returns: "Your CPE is not showing on our network. Please check power and antenna direction." OR "Your AP (Tower-X Sector 2) is currently down for maintenance, ETA 1 hour." OR "Your building materials may be blocking signal; let's try a different CPE location."

#### 21.4e — Diagnostic: "My Wi-Fi doesn't work" (Both Fiber & WISP)

1. Checks CPE/Wi-Fi router via TR-069 (online? SSID broadcasting?)
2. Reads Wi-Fi channel and client count
3. Detects if Wi-Fi password was recently changed (via account)
4. Suggests: restart router, check Wi-Fi password, move device closer
5. If CPE offline → restart via TR-069
→ If unresolved after steps → escalate with full diagnostic dump

#### 21.4f — Diagnostic: "My internet disconnects frequently"

*Fiber branch:*
1. Reads RADIUS session history (frequent drops?)
2. Checks ONU optical signal stability (fluctuating Rx power = fiber issue)
3. Checks OLT PON port error counters
4. Checks CPE uptime and reboot frequency
→ Returns possible cause: fiber splice issue, CPE overheating, ONU failing, etc.

*Wireless branch:*
1. Reads RADIUS session history (frequent drops?)
2. Checks CPE signal fluctuation pattern (intermittent fade = alignment or obstruction)
3. Checks AP uptime and reboot events (channel change? firmware reload?)
4. Checks for interference events (new AP on same channel detected?)
→ Returns: "Your signal fluctuates between -60 and -78 dBm — likely antenna movement or new obstruction. Recommend re-alignment." OR "Your AP changed channel from 5180 to 5220 at 3 AM — CPE may need manual reconnect."

#### 21.4g — Diagnostic: "I can connect to the internet but very slowly at night" (Both)

*Fiber branch:* Checks PON port utilization during peak hours — if >85%, PON is congested.

*Wireless branch:* Checks AP client count during peak hours — if near capacity, subscribers share bandwidth. Checks if night-time rates differ from plan.

→ Returns: "Your PON port serves 45 users and is at 89% capacity during 7-11 PM. Upgrade available for dedicated bandwidth." OR "Your sector has 1 free slot remaining. During peak hours bandwidth is shared — upgrade plan for guaranteed speed."

  - [x] WISP: "CPE not connecting" → check CPE visible on any AP → check signal/SNR → check RADIUS → check alignment → check weather
- [x] **Network topology**:
  - [x] Fiber: AI knows which OLT/ONU serves each customer, understands PON port → splitter → ONU relationships
  - [x] Wireless: AI knows which AP/sector covers each customer, understands tower → sector → CPE relationships, Fresnel zone, distance, antenna types
- [x] **Coverage maps**: Fiber serviceability by address; wireless LOS (line of sight) availability, tower locations, sector azimuth/bearing
- [x] **Regulatory FAQ**: PROFECO rights, CFDI requirements, cancellation policy (Mexican law)
- [x] **Product documentation**: ONU/CPE user guides, AP/CPE antenna guides (Ubiquiti, MikroTik, Cambium, Mimosa), Wi-Fi configuration steps, alignment guides
- [x] **Real-time system state**: NMS alerts (OLT/AP), RADIUS sessions, ONU/CPE status, AP noise floor, weather data (not training data — live queries)
- [x] **Common responses (templates)**: Pre-approved responses for frequent scenarios (both fiber and wireless) to ensure consistency

**Continuous learning**:
- [x] Every resolved AI conversation is logged (anonymized)
- [x] Tickets that required human escalation are flagged for KB improvement
- [x] Monthly KB review: new articles added for emerging issues
- [x] A/B testing of AI responses for resolution rate optimization
- [x] Human agents can mark AI responses as "helpful" or "wrong" → feedback loop

### 21.9 AI Guardrails & Safety

- [x] **Never access raw customer PII** in LLM context — use customer ID references internally, resolve PII only for response
- [x] **Never make billing adjustments without explicit customer confirmation** — AI proposes, customer confirms
- [x] **Never reveal internal system details** (SNMP community strings, RADIUS secrets, server IPs, internal IPs)
- [x] **Never impersonate a human** — always identify as "AI assistant" or virtual agent
- [x] **Never make promises** ("I guarantee your internet will be back in 5 minutes") — use "typically" / "usually"
- [x] **Escalate on legal/regulatory topics** — AI should NOT give legal advice
- [x] **Rate limit per customer** — max N AI interactions per hour to prevent abuse
- [x] **Log everything** — all AI conversations logged with timestamps, confidence scores, data sources accessed
- [x] **Prompt injection protection** — customer messages sanitized before LLM context injection
- [x] **Retention policy** — AI conversation logs subject to same data retention rules as CRM data (Section 16)

### 21.11 NOC AI Assistant (Internal)

Beyond customer-facing AI, the same engine assists NOC staff:

*Fiber examples:*
- [x] **Alert explanation**: "OLT-X PON port 3/1/5 Rx power dropped 5 dB" → AI correlates: "This is affecting 23 subscribers. One ONU (SN:XXX) shows Rx -28 dB (near threshold). Last fiber splice at splitter 3B. Recommend check splice."
- [x] **Capacity warning**: "PON port 2/1/7 at 82% utilization. At this growth rate (3%/month), will hit 95% in 5 months. Recommend preemptive split or OLT upgrade."

*Wireless examples:*
- [x] **Alert explanation**: "AP Tower-3 Sector 2 (5.8 GHz) — 3 CPEs dropped in last 10 min" → AI correlates: "Signal dropped 8 dB across all 3 CPEs simultaneously. Weather radar shows heavy rain cell moving through. Likely rain fade. Will recover when weather clears."
- [x] **Interference detection**: "AP Tower-1 Sector 1 noise floor increased from -95 to -82 dBm on channel 5180" → AI correlates: "New AP detected on same channel 2.3 km away (ISP competitor or new deployment). Recommend channel change to 5220 or 5745."
- [x] **Capacity warning**: "AP Tower-2 Sector 3 at 47/50 clients. Average throughput per client dropped to 4 Mbps (plan: 10 Mbps). Recommend sector split or new AP deployment."
- [x] **Alignment drift**: "CPE SN:XXX signal trending down 0.5 dB/day over 2 weeks. Current: -71 dBm (threshold: -75 dBm). Recommend schedule re-alignment visit before signal drops below threshold."

*General:*
- [x] **On-call summary**: At shift change, AI generates summary of all open issues, ongoing outages, tickets pending
- [x] **Runbook suggestion**: AI suggests troubleshooting steps based on alert type (learns from past NOC actions)

## Appendix A — Architecture Recommendations

### High Availability
- [x] Database: primary + read replica with streaming replication — shipped on **MySQL 8.4 GTID** replication (docker-compose.prod.yml:59-129, docs/deployment.md:895-935). "PostgreSQL" above is stack-survey wording; the capability is what shipped.
- [x] Application: Load-balanced app servers (2+ behind HAProxy/Nginx) — k8s replicas:2 + hpa.yaml (2-10), Nginx reverse proxy, documented `--scale app=3`.
- [x] Redis for caching and session management (Redis Sentinel for HA) — redis in both compose files, REDIS_URL wired app-wide (BullMQ/cache/rate-limit); Sentinel documented for operators (deployment.md:1009-1040).
- [ ] Shared storage or block-level replication for file attachments — **LIVE BUG:** tickets.js:25 and workOrders.js:49 write to /app/uploads, outside the mounted /app/storage volume → lost on container recreate, and EROFS under k8s (readOnlyRootFilesystem). Queued as jobdesk work.
- [x] Automated failover with health checks — k8s liveness/readiness/startup probes, PodDisruptionBudget, RollingUpdate maxUnavailable:0, Dockerfile HEALTHCHECK. (App tier; DB failover is a documented manual runbook step.)

### Performance Targets
- ◷ 10,000 subscribers on a single 4 vCPU / 8 GB server — **never measured.** Rig exists (docs/load-testing.md, autocannon) but the fixture seeds only 500 clients / 5k invoices / 100 devices.
- ◷ 50,000+ subscribers: distributed architecture required — **never verified at scale.** Building blocks exist (HPA to 10 replicas, read replica, Redis).
- ◷ SNMP polling <30s per device at 10,000 devices — **never measured.** Poller is real and device-proven; no test exercises poll-cycle duration at device-count scale.
- ◷ Page load <2 seconds for all dashboard pages — **never measured**; no Lighthouse/web-vitals/perf-budget tooling exists.
- ✅ API response <200ms for CRUD — **MEASURED AND PASSING.** docs/load-testing.md gates p99 ≤200ms (sample p50 17-20ms, p99 22-35ms, CI-gateable). The first run caught a real LIMIT/OFFSET bug in BaseModel.findAll.

### Recommended Stack (Budget-Oriented)
- ⊘ Backend: Python (Django/FastAPI) or PHP (Laravel) — **surveyed, not chosen.** VigaBSS is Node/Express. Never tickable.
- ⊘ Database: PostgreSQL (primary) + Redis (cache) — **surveyed, not chosen.** VigaBSS is MySQL + Redis. Never tickable.
- [x] Frontend: React SPA dashboard + Nginx — frontend/ (154 pages), nginx in prod compose and k8s ingress.
- [x] RADIUS: FreeRADIUS 3.x with MySQL backend — docs/freeradius/, radiusService.syncFreeradiusTables(); embedded RADIUS also available.
- [ ] NMS: Custom SNMP poller + LibreNMS/Zabbix integration
- [x] Queue: Redis chosen (not RabbitMQ) — BullMQ via scheduler.js:6,84.
- [x] Storage: MinIO (S3-compatible, self-hosted) for file backups — cloudStorageService SigV4 + BACKUP_S3_ENDPOINT, UI-configurable, live-verified against MinIO.

### Scalability Considerations
- [ ] Horizontal scaling for polling engine (add poller nodes)
- [x] Database partitioning by date for accounting records — connection_logs and snmp_metrics both PARTITION BY RANGE (migrations 025/032).
- [ ] CDN for static assets and customer portal
- [x] Containerized deployment (Docker / Docker Compose) for easy scaling — Dockerfile, 5 compose files, k8s/, Helm chart, install.sh.

## Appendix B — Compliance Checklist (Mexico)

- [x] Subscriber identity capture (INE/IFE/CURP) — identity_verification_records + CURP checksum + verify/reject endpoints (regulatoryCompliance.js:231-324) + UI tab.
- [ ] LFPDPPP Aviso de Privacidad displayed and accepted — API + subscriber_consents table exist (regulatoryCompliance.js:41-113) but **nothing ever displays the notice or captures acceptance**; staff tab is read-only. Queued as jobdesk work.
- [x] IP-to-subscriber log retention configured and verified — connection_logs monthly partitions + scheduled purge_radius_accounting (taskRunner.js:149-151, migration 233) + 2-year partition-drop procedure.
- [x] Log integrity protection (append-only / WORM) — DB-level BEFORE UPDATE/DELETE SIGNAL triggers on audit_logs (schema.sql:7601-7620); row_hash on gov_data_requests.
- [x] Lawful interception capability documented and operational — gov_data_requests (migration 315) with intake/fulfill/reject workflow; docs/compliance-mexico.md §4.
- [x] CFDI 4.0 invoicing integration with PAC — stamp + cancel against SW and Finkok with failover, local sealing, CFDI de Egreso (#528); both PACs sandbox-proven.
- [x] Tax regimen facturacion (regimen fiscal) properly configured — org + client regimen_fiscal validated against the sat_regimen_fiscal catalog, enforced at stamp time (cfdiService.js:116-123).
- [x] Complaint response SLA configured — sla_definitions + ticket_sla_events + scheduled sla_breach_check (taskRunner.js:171-172); profeco_complaints rides the same machinery.
- ⊘ Consumer terms template compliant with PROFECO — **operator action** (legal drafting with your counsel). Software already stores/versions templates (contract_templates_mx) and handles complaints (profeco_complaints).
- [x] Data backup within Mexican territory (verify latest rules) — data_residency_config (default MX) + dataResidency CRUD + /check + UI tab. Self-attestation by design in a self-hosted product.
- [x] Audit trail activated for all administrative actions — auditLog service writing to the WORM audit_logs table, wired in 18 route modules.
- [x] Access control policy documented and enforced — docs/rbac-permissions.md + requirePermission() on every route.
- [x] Incident response plan documented — docs/runbook.md:237+ "Incident Response (P1.9)": severity matrix, declaration criteria, workflow, SEV1 scenarios.
- ⊘ Annual compliance self-assessment scheduled — **operator action** (calendar). Automated inputs exist (DSAR-overdue check, data-residency /check) but the review itself is yours.
- ⊘ ATDT/CRT registration and licensing up to date — **operator legal act.** Software ships full tracking (concession_titles with expiration/renewal_filed_at, regulatory_filings) but cannot make a licence current.
