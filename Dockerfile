# `build` here is gen:api + a whole-program `tsc --noEmit` over 376 files + Vite
# with sourcemaps — measured at ~1.43 GB peak RSS, and by default V8 will keep
# growing until the machine says no. Bounding old-space turns "the host starts
# swapping and stops responding" into "the build fails with a clean JavaScript
# heap OOM", which is a far better failure: it is loud, it is attributable, and
# it leaves the running stack untouched.
#
# CI builds on a 16 GB runner so this never binds there. It matters for anyone
# building locally via docker-compose.build.yml, which is where a small host is
# actually at risk.

# The commit this image was built from. Nothing in the running app knew this
# before: package.json carries a static "5.0.0" that has not moved in the
# platform's lifetime, so "what is actually deployed?" could only be answered by
# SSHing in and reading `git rev-parse HEAD` — which reports the SOURCE tree,
# not the image, and those two disagree precisely when it matters (a rollback
# pins an older image against a newer checkout).
