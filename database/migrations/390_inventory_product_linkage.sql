-- Migration 390 — Inventory Phase 2: product linkage + sale drawdown
-- =============================================================================
-- Links inventory_items into the invoice/quote "product" catalog so a
-- physical stock item can be sold on an invoice/quote and (for invoices)
-- automatically decrement stock with a ledger row.
--
--   * plan_addons.inventory_item_id    — optional link: this catalog product
--     is backed by a physical inventory_items row.
--   * invoice_items.inventory_item_id  — which inventory item an invoice line
--     sold, if any. Drives automatic stock drawdown in POST /invoices/:id/items
--     and POST /quotes/:id/convert-to-invoice.
--   * quote_items.inventory_item_id    — same link on a quote line, carried
--     through unchanged to invoice_items on conversion (quotes themselves
--     never draw down stock — only converting to an invoice does).
--   * quotes.converted_invoice_id      — back-reference set atomically (same
--     transaction as the invoice INSERT) by POST /quotes/:id/convert-to-invoice.
--     Makes conversion idempotent: a second convert (double-click/retry) is
--     rejected with 409 CONVERSION_EXISTS instead of creating a duplicate
--     invoice and re-running drawdownForSale per linked line (adversarial
--     review finding — the prior guard only checked quote.status, which the
--     conversion itself leaves at 'accepted', so a retry sailed straight
--     through). Nullable FK (ON DELETE SET NULL — deleting the invoice must
--     never cascade-delete the quote) guarded via INFORMATION_SCHEMA.
--
-- All four are nullable FKs (ON DELETE SET NULL — deleting an inventory item
-- or invoice must never cascade-delete billing history) and guarded via
-- INFORMATION_SCHEMA so this migration is idempotent (see migration 371/374
-- pattern).
--
-- Also drops the migration-127 "negative stock guard" trigger
-- (trg_inventory_stock_negative_bu). Policy v1 for sale drawdown
-- (PR brief, user-confirmed): invoicing a linked product must NEVER fail
-- because of a stock-count drift — negative inventory_stock.quantity becomes
-- an explicit, allowed state (rendered in red in the UI) instead of a
-- blocking SQLSTATE '45000' error. Without dropping this trigger, any sale
-- that would take stock below zero would roll back the entire invoice-item
-- transaction with a raw MySQL error. DROP TRIGGER IF EXISTS is naturally
-- idempotent. Accepted trade-off (org-wide policy, user-confirmed): this also
-- lets pre-existing manual outbound transactions (assign_to_job/transfer_out
-- via POST /inventory/transactions) go negative where they previously got a
-- loud SIGNAL error — negative stock is allowed everywhere now, not just for
-- sale drawdown, and is rendered red in the UI.
