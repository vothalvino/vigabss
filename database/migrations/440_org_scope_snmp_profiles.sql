-- =============================================================================
-- Migration 440 — org-scope snmp_profiles, and lock the ones that ship
-- =============================================================================
-- Continues the BaseModel org-scoping sweep (425 device_config_backups +
-- recurring_payment_profiles, 426 radius, 429 sla_definitions, 435
-- scheduled_tasks, 437 outages, 438 speed_tests).
--
-- src/models/SnmpProfile.js declares hasOrgScope = false and the table has no
-- organization_id, so every verb behind the generic crudController ran
-- unscoped: any tenant could read, rewrite or DELETE another tenant's polling
-- profiles. A profile decides which OIDs are polled from which devices, so a
-- hostile or careless edit silently blinds another ISP's monitoring — the
-- damage is to observability, which is exactly the thing you would rely on to
-- notice it.
--
-- TWO KINDS OF PROFILE, and the distinction is the point of this migration.
--
--   SYSTEM profiles (is_system = 1, organization_id NULL) — the vendor library
--   that ships with VigaBSS: Generic IF-MIB, Ubiquiti airOS, MikroTik RouterOS,
--   Cambium, Mimosa, Tarana, Radwin, Siklu. Visible to every tenant, editable
--   by NONE. They are product content, not customer data: letting one tenant
--   retune "MikroTik RouterOS" would change what every other tenant polls, and
--   an accidental delete would break polling install-wide with no way back
--   short of re-running the seed.
--
--   TENANT profiles (is_system = 0) — created through the API, owned by the
--   org that created them, invisible to everyone else.
--
-- WHY MATCH ON NAME rather than "everything that exists right now": an operator
-- who already created custom profiles before this migration must not have them
-- locked. Only the eight names VigaBSS itself seeds are marked system; anything
-- else becomes an unattributed legacy row (organization_id NULL), visible to
-- all and ADOPTED by the first tenant that writes to it — the same treatment
-- outages and speed_tests got, for the same reason.
--
-- THE UNIQUE KEY HAS TO WIDEN. uq_snmp_profiles_name is (name, active_flag),
-- i.e. install-wide. Once profiles are per-tenant that means org B cannot
-- create a profile with a name org A already used, surfacing as a confusing
-- duplicate-key 500 rather than anything an operator could act on. It becomes
-- (organization_id, name, active_flag).
--
-- active_flag is a GENERATED column — referenced in the index only, never
-- written, because MySQL rejects any explicit value for one.
--
-- Guarded via INFORMATION_SCHEMA (idempotent — safe to re-run on MySQL 8).
