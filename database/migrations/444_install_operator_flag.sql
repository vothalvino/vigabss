-- Migration 444 — mark the INSTALL OPERATOR explicitly (j56)
-- =============================================================================
-- VigaBSS had no way to say "this account runs the box". Code that needed the
-- idea used `users.role = 'admin'`, which cannot express it: `roles` is a
-- GLOBAL table, migration 378 marks both the `admin` and `super_admin` groups
-- kind='admin', and User.resolveGroupMirror copies group.kind into users.role —
-- so EVERY organisation's admin carries it. That let any tenant admin rewrite
-- install-wide settings and trigger a host redeploy.
--
-- An earlier attempt inferred the operator from the number of organisations on
-- the install. That was worse than it looked: the count moves. The ordinary
-- onboarding move (create your real organisation, delete the seeded demo one)
-- left a soft-deleted row behind, and the box owner silently and permanently
-- lost the update button with a bare 404 — no attacker required. Any inferred
-- signal has this shape, so this migration stops inferring and stores the fact.
--
-- WHO GETS IT HERE depends on the shape of the install, decided ONCE at
-- migration time (a one-off judgement about existing data, not a rule the
-- runtime re-derives — that mistake is described above):
--
--   * ONE organisation — every active legacy admin keeps the capability they
--     have today. They all work for the ISP that owns the box; there is no
--     other tenant for them to be dangerous to, and silently demoting an
--     operator's colleagues on upgrade would break working installs for no
--     security gain.
--   * MORE THAN ONE organisation — only the OLDEST active legacy admin, who
--     is whoever set the box up, ahead of any tenant onboarded later. This is
--     where "any admin" stops being a safe answer.
--
-- Nobody GAINS anything either way: every one of these accounts already passed
-- the old `role = 'admin'` check. The flag only stops everyone else passing it.
-- If it lands on the wrong account, INSTALL_OPERATOR_USER_IDS overrides it
-- without a migration.
--
-- The column is not in User.fillable and is not accepted by any validation
-- schema, so it cannot be granted through the API at all. It is set here, by
-- the seeder for a fresh install, or by hand with INSTALL_OPERATOR_USER_IDS in
-- the environment.
--
-- Guarded via INFORMATION_SCHEMA (idempotent — safe to re-run on MySQL 8).
