-- Migration 448 — install test window
-- =============================================================================
-- Until now a freshly provisioned (pending) contract's RADIUS account was
-- created status='active' and findSubscriber checks ONLY radius.status — so
-- the line came up at provisioning time and stayed up, unbilled, until formal
-- activation. Product decision (2026-08-05, both MX and global orgs): new
-- provisions start INACTIVE; the technician opens a bounded TEST WINDOW on
-- site (full internet, speed test included), the window closes by hand or by
-- sweep, and formal activation is what turns the line on permanently.
--
--   * contracts.test_window_expires_at — the bound. Set when the technician
--     starts the window (NOW() + install_test_window_minutes org setting,
--     default 60); cleared on activation and on window end. The sweep only
--     ever touches PENDING contracts whose bound has passed — activated
--     contracts and pre-448 grandfathered pending lines are never disabled
--     by it (existing pending contracts keep their active accounts; only
--     provisioning DEFAULTS change, so no surprise outages on live installs).
--
-- Seeds the test_window_expiry sweep task (every 5 minutes; the case is added
-- to src/services/taskRunner.js in the same PR — a seeded task with no case
-- never runs, silently).
--
-- Guarded via INFORMATION_SCHEMA (idempotent — safe to re-run on MySQL 8).
