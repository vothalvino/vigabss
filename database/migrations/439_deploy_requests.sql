-- Migration 439 — deploy requests + host agent heartbeat
-- =============================================================================
-- Lets the install operator trigger a redeploy from the web GUI WITHOUT giving
-- the application container any privilege on the host.
--
-- WHY THIS SHAPE. The obvious implementation mounts the Docker socket into the
-- app container. That is root on the host: any RCE or path traversal in VigaBSS
-- would own the machine rather than the app. The same architecture was already
-- refused for the TLS renew button, and it is refused here.
--
-- Instead the container only ever INSERTS A ROW. A systemd timer running as
-- root OUTSIDE the container claims that row and executes one fixed command —
-- redeploy.sh, with no arguments.
--
-- THE REQUEST CARRIES NO TARGET. There is deliberately no commit/tag/image
-- column: a request that could name what to deploy would hand a compromised app
-- an arbitrary-image-deploy primitive, which is most of what the Docker socket
-- would have given away. The agent always deploys whatever CI has published for
-- current main. A full app compromise therefore buys an attacker "trigger a
-- redeploy of the signed image that was going to be deployed anyway".
--
-- NOT ORG-SCOPED, and this is the one table where that is correct rather than
-- an oversight: a deploy is an act on the INSTALL. There is no organization_id
-- because there is no tenant whose deploy this is, and the routes gate on the
-- legacy users.role='admin' rather than a permission slug — migration 119
-- grants org admins every slug, so a slug would reach exactly the wrong people.
--
-- Guarded via INFORMATION_SCHEMA (idempotent — safe to re-run on MySQL 8).

-- ── Agent heartbeat ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
-- Without this the button is a stub that fakes success: on an install whose
-- operator never set up the systemd units, pressing it would queue a row that
-- nothing will ever service, and the UI would sit on "pending" forever with no
-- way to tell that from a slow deploy. CLAUDE.md calls a stub whose UI fakes
-- success a bug rather than a feature, so the agent stamps this every poll and
-- the UI refuses to offer the button when it has gone stale.
