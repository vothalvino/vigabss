-- VigaBSS 5.0 — Rollback 185: Remove org scope from expenses
-- =============================================================================
-- Reverses migration 185 by dropping the organization_id foreign key, index,
-- and column from the expenses table.  Uses guarded INFORMATION_SCHEMA checks
-- so the rollback is idempotent and safe to re-run.
