# VigaBSS deploy agent — the privileged half of the "Update" button.
#
# Runs on the HOST as root, outside Docker, on a systemd timer. Claims a pending
# row from deploy_requests and runs redeploy.sh. That is the whole job.
#
# Install (one time):
#     sudo cp /opt/fireisp/deploy/fireisp-deploy-agent.{service,timer} /etc/systemd/system/
#     sudo systemctl daemon-reload
#     sudo systemctl enable --now fireisp-deploy-agent.timer
#
# The unit runs this file from the checkout, so `redeploy` keeps the agent up to
# date on its own — there is no copy in /usr/local/bin to fall out of step.
#
# ── Why this exists at all ───────────────────────────────────────────────────
#
# A GUI button that restarts the stack needs authority the application must not
# have. Mounting the Docker socket into the app container is root on the host:
# any RCE or path traversal in VigaBSS would own the machine, not just the app.
# That architecture was refused for the TLS renew button and is refused here.
#
# So the privilege lives here instead, and the container's only power is to
# INSERT A ROW.
#
# ── The invariant that makes that safe ───────────────────────────────────────
#
# THIS SCRIPT NEVER READS AN ARGUMENT OUT OF THE DATABASE. It runs redeploy.sh
# with no arguments, always. The request row's ONLY meaning is "somebody asked".
# There is deliberately no target column: a request that could name a commit or
# an image would hand a compromised app an arbitrary-image-deploy primitive,
# which is most of what the Docker socket would have given away.
#
# Worst case, with the app fully compromised: an attacker can trigger a redeploy
# of the signed image CI already published for current main — the thing that was
# going to be deployed anyway. Nothing is parameterised, so nothing is injectable.

# The agent deliberately has NO API token and no network listener: it talks to
# MySQL through the existing compose stack, so there is no new credential to
# leak and no new port to reach.
#
# It does NOT re-parse .env.prod for credentials. An earlier version did
# (grep | cut), and any file format compose's dotenv parser accepts but a naive
# grep does not — quoted values, an `export` prefix, CRLF endings, a repeated
# key where the later definition wins — made every run fail "Access denied" on
# a box where the app itself was connecting fine. Instead the query runs with
# the MYSQL_USER / MYSQL_PASSWORD / MYSQL_DATABASE that compose already
# injected into the MySQL container: the same parse, of the same file, that the
# running stack authenticates with. If the app can log in, so can the agent —
# by construction. (.env.prod stays required above: compose itself needs it to
# interpolate the stack; this script just never re-reads its values.)

# The compose service that runs MySQL. `db-primary`, NOT `db` — this script
# originally guessed `db` and every run died with "no such service: db", so the
# heartbeat was never written and the Update button never appeared. Overridable
# for a non-standard compose file; tests cross-check the default against
# docker-compose.prod.yml so it cannot silently drift again.
