# VigaBSS 0.1.0-alpha.1

Open source ISP management software for customer operations, billing, network management, compliance, and modern self-service/admin workflows.

> **Pre-release:** `0.1.0-alpha.1` is the first VigaBSS alpha. Test backups,
> upgrades, network automation, and billing workflows in a non-production
> environment before relying on them operationally.

## Quick Install

Deploy VigaBSS 0.1.0-alpha.1 on Ubuntu/Debian in a single command (other Linux
distributions work when the prerequisites are installed first):

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vothalvino/vigabss/main/install.sh | bash
```

The installer will prompt for your domain name and email, then automatically:

- Clone the repository to `/opt/vigabss`
- Generate strong random passwords and secrets
- Obtain a free TLS certificate via Let's Encrypt
- Pull the published application image on amd64/arm64 (or build it on an
  unsupported architecture) and start MySQL, Redis, the app, and Nginx
- Run database migrations and seed default data

**Prerequisites:** a root shell on the target server and a domain that already
resolves to it. On Ubuntu/Debian the installer adds missing curl, Git, OpenSSL,
Docker CE, and Docker Compose v2 automatically. Install those dependencies
yourself first on another distribution.

### Options

Pass variables to the `bash` process after the pipe to skip interactive prompts:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vothalvino/vigabss/main/install.sh \
  | DOMAIN=isp.example.com EMAIL=admin@example.com bash
```

| Variable | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `DOMAIN` | *(prompted)* | Public domain name pointing to this server |
| `EMAIL` | *(prompted)* | Admin email — used for Let's Encrypt and first login |
| `INSTALL_DIR` | `/opt/vigabss` | Installation directory |
| `SKIP_TLS` | `0` | Set to `1` to use a self-signed certificate (dev/testing) |
| `DB_PASSWORD` | *(auto-generated)* | MySQL application user password |
| `DB_ROOT_PASSWORD` | *(auto-generated)* | MySQL root password |
| `MYSQL_REPL_PASSWORD` | *(auto-generated)* | MySQL replication password |
| `REDIS_PASSWORD` | *(auto-generated)* | Redis password |
| `JWT_SECRET` | *(auto-generated)* | JWT signing secret (64 chars) |
| `ENCRYPTION_KEY` | *(auto-generated)* | AES-256 key for secrets stored at rest |
| `GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY` | — | Google Maps Geocoding API key — enables resolving a client service address to GPS coordinates (`POST /api/v1/clients/:id/geocode`). When unset, geocoding returns `503` and coordinates can still be entered manually. |

All generated credentials are saved to `/opt/vigabss/.env.prod` (mode `600`).

Existing FireISP-era installs remain supported at `/opt/fireisp`; do not move
that directory or rename its Docker volumes or database merely to match the new
defaults. Their existing wrappers and `FIREISP_*` compatibility variables keep
working. New documentation uses the VigaBSS names.

> **Full deployment guide:** [`docs/deployment.md`](docs/deployment.md) covers bare-metal, Docker Compose, Kubernetes, TLS setup, MySQL tuning, and a production checklist.
> **FreeRADIUS integration:** [`docs/freeradius/README.md`](docs/freeradius/README.md) covers installing FreeRADIUS 3.x, pointing `rlm_sql` at the VigaBSS MySQL database, enabling PPPoE/MAB/802.1X/EAP-TLS, and generating `clients.conf` from the `nas` table.

## Features

- Customer management
- Service plan management
- Billing, invoicing, and credit notes with multi-currency support (ISO 4217)
- SAT CFDI 4.0 Mexican e-invoicing — PAC stamping (Finkok, SW Sapien, FacturAPI, etc.), CSD certificate management with expiry monitoring, Complemento de Pago 2.0, cancellation workflow, factura pública aggregation (venta al público en general)
- Payment gateway integrations (Stripe, Conekta, OpenPay, MercadoPago, PayPal) with recurring autopay profiles and stored card tokens
- Network device monitoring with SNMP metrics collection
- Tenant-scoped RADIUS session/usage evidence plus privacy-minimal, case-gated CGNAT source-tuple attribution; these are operator controls, not automatic legal certification
- Inventory and warehouse management — track spare equipment across multiple storage locations
- User and role management with RBAC (roles, permissions, role_permissions) — default roles and permissions seeded on install
- IP address management (IPAM) with IPv4, IPv6, and dual-stack support
- Audit logging and notifications
- Email / SMS / WhatsApp send log for auditing and billing disputes
- Service outage tracking with SLA reporting hooks
- Scheduled task observability and active session management — fifteen core automation tasks seeded on install (`auto_generate_invoices`, `auto_suspend_overdue`, `radius_sync`, `populate_revenue_summary`, `populate_network_health_snapshots`, `csd_expiry_monitor`, `alert_evaluation`, `process_recurring_charges`, `data_retention`, `payment_retry`, `billing_cycle`, `database_backup`, `config_backup`, `webhook_retry`, `quarterly_dr_drill`)
- Monitoring alert rules with configurable thresholds, severity levels, and multi-channel notifications (email, SMS, SSE, webhook)
- Two-factor authentication (TOTP) with backup codes and brute-force account lockout
- Single sign-on (SSO) — per-organization SAML 2.0 and OIDC IdP configuration, automatic user provisioning on first login, and IdP group-to-VigaBSS role mappings
- Per-tenant resource quotas — configurable upper bounds per organization for clients, devices, storage, and scheduled tasks (NULL = unlimited; absence of a quota row = unlimited)
- Per-tenant database isolation — opt-in physically isolated MySQL/MariaDB database per organization; tenant-aware pool routing via `AsyncLocalStorage` context in `orgScope`; admin API to configure, verify (`POST /test`), and switch between shared and isolated modes; `MIGRATE_ISOLATED_TENANTS=true pnpm run migrate` applies the same migration set to every enabled isolated tenant database
- Background job platform (BullMQ) — optional Redis-backed distributed job queues for webhook delivery, SMS dispatch, CFDI stamping retries, config-backup pulls, and scheduled-task execution; inline fallback when `REDIS_URL` is not configured; per-queue stats surfaced at `/api/v1/queue-stats`
- FireRelay cluster mode for multi-node deployments with client routing
- Outbound webhooks with HMAC signing, configurable retries, and dead-letter queue for failed deliveries
- Inbound webhook event deduplication and idempotent payment processing
- Configurable suspension rules — auto-suspend, auto-disconnect, and notify-only actions with grace periods and plan-scoping
- Data retention policies with configurable TTL purge (audit logs, alert events, webhook deliveries, email/SMS logs, idempotency keys, RADIUS post-auth events, and PPPoE diagnostics events)
- Circuit breaker pattern for external service resilience (RADIUS, payment gateways, PAC stamping)
- Geographic service areas and coverage zones with WGS 84 boundary polygons
- Speed test recording from client portal, technician tools, automated probes, and external services
- IFT/CRT regulatory-support records — concession titles, periodic filings, statistical reports, and operator-entered adhesion-contract registration metadata; see the [legal register](docs/legal-regulatory-register.md) for applicability and validation boundaries
- Customer lifecycle management — a guided lead → installation order → pending contract handoff, assigned installation visit, bounded technician PPPoE test window, recorded speed result, automatic test shutoff, field acceptance, explicit optional Email/SMS/WhatsApp choices, and customer signature before permanent service; MX organizations can rehearse with permanently watermarked VigaBSS-only sandbox evidence before switching new contracts to an exact externally registered production source, while global organizations sign a neutral service-installation acknowledgment
- Customer interaction tracking — unified per-client activity timeline (calls, emails, tickets, payments, visits), manual interaction logging, follow-up reminders with automated due notifications, NPS/CSAT satisfaction surveys (auto-dispatched on ticket resolution) with aggregate metrics, and ticket escalation management with auto-escalation of stale unresolved tickets
- Internationalization (i18n) — English, Spanish, and Brazilian Portuguese locale support
- Customer self-service portal (§11) — dashboard with plan overview, live session status, daily usage graph; invoice PDF/CFDI download; online payment (card/OXXO/SPEI/PayPal via checkout session); payment history; self-service requests (plan upgrade with proration, Wi-Fi/PPPoE password change, static IP, cancellation, visit schedule) with admin approval workflow; knowledge-base / FAQ with rating; embedded speed test (queues `subscriber_speed_test_jobs`, results view); AI-powered chatbot with automatic ticket-creation fallback; callback request; Web Push notification subscriptions (outage/billing/ticket events); PWA with offline service worker and web app manifest
- RESTful API with an OpenAPI 3.1 contract covering 1,001 paths, interactive Swagger UI documentation (`/api/docs`), and a static specification (`docs/openapi.json`)
- GraphQL gateway (`/api/v1/graphql`) powered by graphql-yoga v5 — single-request multi-entity fetches, real-time subscriptions via SSE (PubSub), and a live ClientDetail query replacing multiple REST round-trips
- Real-time event hub (WebSocket + SSE dual-broadcast) — live Dashboard device-status indicator, live TicketDetail comment stream, and a useWebSocket React hook for all frontend consumers
- httpOnly SameSite=Strict cookie authentication — access token in memory, refresh token in httpOnly cookie, Origin-based CSRF guard; eliminates localStorage token exposure
- Dark mode — CSS custom-property token system, per-user preference persisted in localStorage, toggle in Layout and PortalLayout
- PROFECO complaint-support workflow — internal intake, lifecycle tracking, staff attribution, and generic export; applicability, protection, official format, submission, and acceptance remain operator responsibilities
- Spec-driven development — `spec:check` drift scanner detects route/schema gaps against the OpenAPI spec in CI; `spec:gen` scaffolds new route stubs from the spec
- Schema-truth enforcement — `sql:check` statically verifies that every `INSERT`/`UPDATE` in the backend names columns that actually exist on that table in `database/schema.sql`, and that every literal written to an `ENUM` column is one of its values. The Jest suite mocks the database, so this is the only gate that catches a mistyped column before it becomes a permanent 500 in production
- OWASP ZAP DAST scan in CI — automated active scan against a live test instance on every push; ZAP HTML report uploaded as a workflow artifact
- Accessibility engineering — jest-axe coverage for selected page/component states plus aria-label fixes; this is not a complete WCAG 2.1 AA conformance audit
- AI Reply Assistant — topology-aware LLM chatbot that drafts (and optionally auto-sends) professional answers to inbound support tickets; pluggable provider registry (OpenAI, Azure OpenAI, Anthropic, Google Gemini, Ollama, custom); phrase library with forbidden-term guard; PII redaction before prompt dispatch; per-org master on/off switch and per-channel toggles; optional RAG via ChromaDB; full audit log. **Emergency kill switch:** `PUT /api/v1/ai/policy` `{"enabled":false}` or untick the master switch in Settings → AI Assistant → General.
- In-app changelog panel — paginated, filterable release history surfaced in the admin sidebar for operators who need to track what changed without leaving the UI
- Kubernetes-ready health probes — `/health/live` (liveness), `/health/ready` (readiness with DB + Redis checks), `/health?detail=true` (detailed)
- CSP nonce-based inline style protection (per-request nonce replaces `unsafe-inline`)
- API versioning with deprecation headers (`Deprecation`, `Sunset`, `Link`) on unversioned `/api/` routes
- IETF draft-7 `RateLimit-*` response headers for API consumers
- Optimistic concurrency control on critical financial records (invoices, contracts, payments, clients)
- Default application settings seeded on install (currency, SMTP, SNMP, security, automation flags)
- Default tax rates seeded on install (Tax Exempt, Standard 8%, IVA 16% MX, GST 5% CA)
- Payment allocation, inventory stock, PPPoE RADIUS consistency, credit note over-credit cap, audit log immutability, CFDI document immutability, contract status FSM, and outage temporal logic enforced at the database level via guard triggers

## Database

VigaBSS 0.1.0-alpha.1 uses MySQL 8.0.29+ (MySQL 8.4 LTS recommended) or MariaDB 10.6+. The schema is located in the `database/` directory.

### Quick Start

Apply the full schema in one step:

```bash
mysql -u <user> -p <database_name> < database/schema.sql
```

Or apply each migration in order:

```bash
for f in database/migrations/*.sql; do mysql -u <user> -p <database_name> < "$f"; done
```

> **Migration 323–335 — Security & Access Control (§17):** webauthn_credentials, admin_ip_allowlist, password_policies, api_key_rate_limits, firewall_rules, ddos_protection_rules, blackhole_routes, dns_blocklists, cpe_security_scans, encryption_key_metadata, data_masking_rules, secure_deletion_log; plus 4 new roles (super_admin, noc_operator, reseller_admin, auditor) and 36 security module permissions.

> **Migration 336–343 — Automation & Scripting (§18):** automation_rules, automation_rule_executions, batch_jobs, batch_job_items, provisioning_pipelines, provisioning_pipeline_stages, remediation_rules, remediation_executions, automation_scripts, script_executions, router_driver_configs, device_command_executions, analytics_anomalies, churn_scores; plus 30 automation/analytics permissions and 3 scheduled tasks (anomaly_detection, churn_score_computation, remediation_evaluation). Script execution is STUB — no child_process dispatch; sandboxed executor required for live runs.

> **Migration 344–347 — Multi-Tenancy / Reseller Support (§19):** resellers (self-referencing hierarchy up to 2 levels deep, white-label branding, commission_rate), reseller_plan_prices (custom pricing overrides per reseller+plan), reseller_commissions (per-invoice earnings with approve/pay workflow), reseller_ip_pool_allocations, reseller_bandwidth_quotas, reseller_olt_port_assignments, reseller_billing_entities; plus `reseller_id` FK on clients table for reseller scoping. Includes 22 permissions across resellers, reseller_plan_prices, reseller_commissions, reseller_*_allocations/quotas/assignments, reseller_billing_entities, and reseller_portal modules, granted to admin, reseller_admin, and super_admin roles.

> **Migration 348–350 — APIs & Integrations (§20):** integration_providers (27-provider catalog seeded idempotently), integration_connections (per-org instances with AES-256-GCM encrypted credentials), integration_sync_logs (execution records). 8 permissions (integration_providers.view, integration_connections.view/create/update/delete/test/sync, integration_sync_logs.view) granted to admin and super_admin. Routes at /api/v1/integrations (10 endpoints). testConnection() and sync() are STUB — no live HTTP; credentials encrypted at rest and never returned in API responses.

> **Migration 351 — §21.2 AI Support:** Adds `support_conversations` and `support_messages` tables for multi-channel AI customer support conversations.

> **Migration 352 — §21.4 Diagnostics:** Adds `ai_diagnostic_runs` for recording diagnostic engine results.

> **Migration 353 — §21.8 Knowledge Base:** Adds `kb_articles`, `kb_article_embeddings`, and `kb_feedback` for the RAG knowledge base.

> **Migration 358 — §21 Scheduled Task:** Seeds the `ai_support_metrics_rollup` task (nightly at 01:00, task_type=other).

> **Migration 369 — Org-level currency:** Adds `currency CHAR(3) NOT NULL DEFAULT 'MXN'` to `organizations` (AFTER country). Each org now has one authoritative ISO 4217 currency; plan create defaults to it when no currency is supplied; Inventory UI reads it dynamically.

> **Migration 371 — NAS access mode:** Adds `access_mode ENUM('direct','nated') NOT NULL DEFAULT 'direct'` to `nas`. In `direct` mode (default) the NAS has a routable IP and VigaBSS connects to it directly. In `nated` mode the device is behind NAT and VigaBSS reaches it exclusively over its WireGuard tunnel; `ip_address` is set to the allocated WG tunnel address at create time so RADIUS, health-checks, and the RouterOS API all use the tunnel uniformly.

> **Migration 165–173 table count note:** See migrations 241–246 below for the §5 Dual Stack tables. See migrations 249–263 for §6.1–6.6 SNMP & NMS tables.

> **Migration 241 — DHCP Server Integration (§5.1):** `241_create_dhcp_integration.sql` creates `dhcp_servers` (DHCP server registry supporting ISC Kea and MikroTik) and `dhcp_static_reservations` (MAC-to-IP bindings with DHCP Option 82 circuit/remote-id for subscriber identification).

> **Migration 242 — NAT/CGNAT and PTR Records (§5.1):** `242_create_nat_ptr_management.sql` creates `nat_pools` (CGNAT/1:1 NAT/PAT pool definitions with external IP ranges and per-subscriber port limits) and `ptr_records` (reverse DNS PTR record management for both IPv4 and IPv6 with configurable TTL and zone).

> **Migration 243 — IPv6 Management Enhancements (§5.2):** `243_ipv6_management_enhancements.sql` adds 7 columns to `ip_pools` (DHCPv6 mode, Router Advertisement flags and lifetime, SLAAC prefix, region name) and `stack_type` to `plans` via stored-procedure guards. Creates `ra_guard_policies` table for per-port RA Guard policy management linked to devices.

> **Migration 244 — Dual-Stack Session Management (§5.3):** `244_dual_stack_session_management.sql` adds IPv6CP/DHCPv6-PD fields to `pppoe_service_profiles` (ipv6cp_enabled, delegated_prefix_len, DNS64), IPv6 RADIUS attributes to `radius` (Framed-IPv6-Address, Delegated-IPv6-Prefix, Framed-IPv6-Pool), and per-session IPv6 accounting fields to `connection_logs` (framed_ipv6_prefix, IPv6 octet counters, stack_type). All via stored-procedure guards; `connection_logs` uses no FK (partitioned table).

> **Migration 245 — IPv6 Transition Mechanisms (§5.4):** `245_create_transition_mechanisms.sql` creates four tables: `tunnel_6rd_configs` (6rd Border Relay + IPv6 prefix), `ds_lite_configs` (DS-Lite AFTR address), `map_rules` (MAP-E/MAP-T rule definitions with EA-bits), and `xlat464_configs` (464XLAT PLAT/CLAT/DNS64 prefixes). Together these support the four major IPv4-to-IPv6 transition mechanisms.

> **Migration 246 — Dual-Stack Permissions Seed (§5):** `246_seed_dual_stack_permissions.sql` seeds 25 permissions (`dhcp_servers.*`, `dhcp_reservations.*`, `nat_pools.*`, `ptr_records.*`, `ra_guard.*`, `transition_mechanisms.*`, `ipv6.management`) and assigns them to roles: admin (all 25), technician (all view permissions + ipv6.management), readonly (view permissions only).

> **Migrations 247–248 — Partition maintenance repair:** `247_repair_scheduled_tasks_seeds.sql` deduplicates and repairs ENUM-corrupted `scheduled_tasks` rows from prior seed migrations. `248_automate_partition_capacity_maintenance.sql` fixes `snmp_maintain_partitions()` and `connection_logs_maintain_partitions()` to start from the current month (not next month), and immediately materializes partitions for the current month through +3 months.

> **Migration 249 — Device Groups (§6.1):** `249_create_device_groups.sql` creates `device_groups` (org-scoped logical grouping by type/location/region/OLT/custom) and `device_group_members` junction table. Enables technicians to organize network devices for bulk operations and filtered monitoring views.

> **Migration 250 — SNMPv3 and Discovery (§6.1):** `250_snmpv3_and_discovery.sql` adds 8 SNMPv3 columns to `devices` (security name, auth/priv protocols, encrypted credentials, context name, last_polled_at, last_poll_error) via INFORMATION_SCHEMA-guarded procedures. Creates `discovery_scans` (CIDR-based network scan jobs with full SNMPv3 credential support) and `discovery_results` (per-host scan outcomes with auto-matched profile suggestions and onboarding status tracking).

> **Migration 251 — SNMP Trap Forwarding Rules (§6.1):** `251_snmp_trap_forwarding_rules.sql` creates the original configuration registry with match criteria (trap type, source IP, OID prefix) and forwarding target fields. These rows remained configuration-only until migration 459 added validated destinations, durable execution, retries, and outcome visibility.

> **Migration 252 — Vendor SNMP Profile Seeds (§6.2):** `252_seed_vendor_snmp_profiles.sql` seeds 8 new `snmp_profiles` with OID mappings: Cisco IOS (CISCO-PROCESS-MIB CPU, CISCO-MEMORY-POOL-MIB), Juniper JunOS (jnxOperatingCPU/Buffer), Huawei VRP (hwAvgDuty5min/hwEntityMemUsage), ZTE ZXAN (zxAnSysMgr CPU/memory), Generic Switch (IF-MIB + PoE RFC 3621), Generic UPS (RFC 1628 UPS-MIB), SFP Diagnostics (ENTITY-SENSOR-MIB Rx/Tx power), Environmental Sensors (ENTITY-SENSOR-MIB temperature/humidity). All ride the existing `snmp_metrics` rollup pipeline.

> **Migration 253 — SNMP Discovery Permissions (§6.1–6.3):** `253_seed_snmp_discovery_permissions.sql` seeds 12 permissions: `device_groups.*` (4), `discovery_scans.*` (4), `trap_forwarding.*` (4). Role matrix: admin (all 12), technician (5 operational permissions), readonly (3 view-only).

Rebuilds the rollup stored procedures to aggregate all new metrics.

> **Migration 256 — Device Monitoring OID Seeds (§6.2):** `256_seed_device_monitoring_oids.sql` seeds SNMP OID entries for extended device metrics: MikroTik board temperature/voltage/fan, SFP Diagnostics (Tx/Rx power, transceiver temp), Generic Switch (ifInDiscards, ifOutDiscards, PoE draw), Generic UPS (battery %, runtime), Environmental Sensors (humidity, ambient temp).

> **Migration 257 — SNMP Metrics Monitoring Permissions (§6.2/6.3):** `257_seed_snmp_monitoring_permissions.sql` seeds 3 new permissions: `snmp_metrics.view`, `snmp_metrics.top_talkers`, `snmp_metrics.interfaces`. Admin and technician receive all 3; readonly receives view-only.

> **Migration 258 — Polling Engine Tables (§6.4):** `258_polling_engine_tables.sql` creates `poller_nodes` (registry of dedicated SNMP poller nodes with heartbeat, queue depth, and performance stats), `device_polling_configs` (per-device or per-device-type polling interval overrides, SNMP GETBULK flags, adaptive polling thresholds, and failover node assignment), and `poller_performance_snapshots` (time-series poller health metrics). Seeds `snmp_adaptive_poll_check` (every 1 min, high priority) and `poller_performance_snapshot` (every 5 min, low priority) scheduled tasks. Adds `pollerEngine.js` service with `getPollingConfig` (4-level precedence lookup), `adaptivePollCheck` (in-memory Map for incidents), `recordPerformanceSnapshot`, and `getPerformanceDashboard`. New routes: `/poller-nodes` (CRUD + performance endpoint), `/device-polling-configs` (CRUD), `/poller-performance` (list + dashboard).

> **Migration 259 — Polling Engine Permissions (§6.4):** `259_seed_polling_engine_permissions.sql` seeds 9 permissions: `poller_nodes.*` (4), `polling_configs.*` (4), `poller_performance.view` (1). Admin gets all 9; technician gets 5 (views + polling_configs create/update + poller_performance.view); readonly gets 3 (views only).

> **Migration 260 — Alerting Enhancement Tables (§6.5):** `260_section65_alerting_tables.sql` creates 5 new tables: `alert_escalation_chains` + `alert_escalation_steps` (L1→L2→L3 escalation with per-step channel/delay config), `maintenance_windows` (alert suppression during planned work, supports recurring via cron), `alert_notification_channels` (multi-channel routing with AES-256-GCM encrypted credentials), `alert_suppression_rules` (upstream→downstream device correlation suppression). Extends `alert_rules` with 7 new columns (escalation_chain_id, flap detection config, baseline/dynamic threshold config) and `alert_events` with 5 new columns (escalation_step, escalated_at, flapping, suppressed, maintenance_window_id). Adds `alertService.evaluateAlertsV2` (maintenance window + correlation suppression + flap detection), `isInMaintenanceWindow`, `isSuppressedByCorrelation`, `checkFlapping`, `triggerEscalation`. Extends ALLOWED_METRICS/SNMP_METRICS with 12 hardware sensor metrics. New routes under `/alerts`: escalation-chains, maintenance-windows, notification-channels, suppression-rules, evaluate-v2.

> **Migration 261 — Alerting Permissions (§6.5):** `261_seed_alert_escalation_permissions.sql` seeds 16 permissions across 4 groups: `alert_escalations.*`, `maintenance_windows.*`, `alert_channels.*`, `alert_suppression.*`. Admin gets all 16; technician gets 8 (all views + maintenance_windows create/update + alert_channels.view); readonly gets 4 (views only).

> **Migration 262 — Config Management Tables (§6.6):** `262_create_config_management_tables.sql` creates 5 new tables: `config_templates` (named templates with {{variable}} placeholders), `config_deployment_records` (push tracking per device), `config_backup_schedules` (per-device/per-org backup schedules extending global nightly task), `config_compliance_rules` (must_contain/must_not_contain/regex_match/regex_not_match audit rules), `config_compliance_results` (audit outcomes per rule per backup).

Seeds 3 disabled global preset rules: BitTorrent Throttle (TCP 6881–6889, throttle to 5M/2M), VoIP Priority (UDP 16384–32767, DSCP EF mark), HTTP/HTTPS Priority (TCP 80,443, DSCP AF21 mark). New `qosService.exportShapingRulesConfig()` generates MikroTik mangle rules script (stub — actual NAS push requires SSH/API). New routes: `/rate-limit-templates` (CRUD + restore + `POST /preview`), `/protocol-shaping-rules` (CRUD + restore + `GET /export/config`). Rate string auto-rendered on create/update.

> **Migration 289 — Rate Limiting Permissions Seed (§10.2):** `289_seed_rate_limiting_permissions.sql` seeds 8 permissions in the `qos` module: `rate_limit_templates.*` (4), `protocol_shaping_rules.*` (4).

> **Migration 298 — NOC, Work Order, and Ticket Extension Permissions Seed (§12):** `298_seed_noc_permissions.sql` seeds 14 permissions across 3 modules: `noc` module (`noc.view`, `work_orders.*` (5), `work_order_materials.*` (3), `technician_tracking.*` (2)), `tickets` module (`ticket_relations.*` (2), `ticket_time_logs.*` (2)). Role matrix: admin (all 14), support (11: all except work_orders.delete, work_order_materials.delete, tracking.ingest), technician (8: work_orders view/update, materials view/create, tracking view/ingest, time_logs view/manage), readonly (6: view-only).

> **Migration 299 — SLA Breach Check Scheduled Task Seed (§12):** `299_seed_sla_breach_check_task.sql` seeds `sla_breach_check` scheduled task (task_type=notification, `*/5 * * * *`) to detect and escalate open tickets approaching or past their SLA deadline. Uses `WHERE NOT EXISTS` guard.

> **Migration 300 — Ticket Attachments (§12):** `300_create_ticket_attachments.sql` creates `ticket_attachments` table (FK to tickets CASCADE) and seeds 3 permissions (view/create/delete) assigned to admin/support/technician/readonly.

> **Migration 301 — Work Order Attachments (§12):** `301_create_workorder_attachments.sql` creates `work_order_attachments` table (FK to work_orders CASCADE) and seeds 3 permissions assigned to admin/support/technician/readonly.



> **Migration 302 — Topology and Mapping Tables (§13):** `302_topology_mapping_tables.sql` adds `latitude`, `longitude`, and `parent_device_id` columns to `devices` via INFORMATION_SCHEMA guards, and creates: `map_geofences` (polygon/radius zones), `map_infrastructure_points` (tower/cabinet/ODF pins), `fiber_route_segments` (fiber polyline segments), `device_dependency_edges` (directed dependency graph for impact analysis).

> **Migration 303 — Topology and Mapping Permissions (§13):** `303_seed_topology_permissions.sql` seeds 12 permissions across topology, mapping, and geofences modules. Admin gets all 12; technician gets 8; support gets 4; readonly gets 2.

> **Migration 304 — Geofence Evaluation Task (§13.2):** `304_seed_geofence_evaluation_task.sql` seeds `geofence_evaluation` scheduled task (task_type=other, `*/10 * * * *`) running `geoFenceService.evaluateAll()` per org.

> **Migration 305 — Inventory & Asset Management Tables (§14):** `305_inventory_asset_management_tables.sql` creates six new tables: `vendors` (supplier registry with contact info, payment terms, currency, soft-delete), `purchase_orders` (PO lifecycle draft→sent→partial→received/cancelled with warehouse destination and line-item totals), `purchase_order_items` (line items with GENERATED STORED total_cost), `assets` (individually tracked physical assets with serial numbers, barcodes, warranty expiry, depreciation, and disposal tracking — linked to vendors, warehouses, and purchase orders), `asset_assignments` (equipment assignment history for customer and device/port targets), and `rma_requests` (RMA workflow with replacement asset tracking).

> **Migration 306 — Inventory & Asset Permissions Seed (§14):** `306_seed_inventory_asset_permissions.sql` seeds 20 permissions across four modules: `vendors.*` (4), `purchase_orders.*` (5 including purchase_orders.receive), `assets.*` (7 including assets.assign/dispose/scan), `rma.*` (4 including rma.close). Role matrix: admin (all 20), technician (8 operational permissions), readonly (4 view-only permissions).

> **Migration 307 — Low-Stock Scheduled Task (§14.1):** `307_seed_inventory_low_stock_task.sql` seeds `inventory_low_stock_check` (task_type=notification, cron `0 * * * *` — every hour) to scan inventory items below their reorder level and dispatch low-stock alert notifications.

> **Migration 308 — Reporting & Analytics Tables (§15):** `308_reporting_analytics_tables.sql` creates three tables: `report_definitions` (template registry with report_type ENUM, parameters JSON schema, output_formats JSON, soft-delete), `scheduled_reports` (delivery schedule with cron_expression, recipients JSON array, last/next run tracking, soft-delete), and `generated_reports` (immutable generation history with file_path, status, generation_time_ms; nullable FK to scheduled_reports).

> **Migration 309 — Dashboard Widgets Table (§15.5):** `309_dashboard_widgets_table.sql` creates `dashboard_widgets` (per-user analytics widget layout: widget_type ENUM with 8 types, position_x/y and width/height grid coordinates, config JSON, is_visible flag; scoped to user + organization).

> **Migration 310 — Custom Reports Table (§15.5):** `310_custom_reports_table.sql` creates `custom_reports` (query_type ENUM sql/visual, sql_query TEXT, visual_config JSON, is_public flag, last_run_at; scoped per organization with soft-delete). The upgraded API additionally requires the DB-revalidated install operator to create, edit, or execute arbitrary SQL reports; SELECT-only keyword checks are defense in depth and are not treated as tenant isolation.

> **Migration 311 — Reporting Permissions Seed (§15):** `311_seed_reporting_permissions.sql` seeds 11 RBAC permissions: `reports.view/generate/schedule/export/manage_definitions`, `dashboard_widgets.view/manage`, `custom_reports.view/create/execute/manage`. Role matrix: admin (all 11), billing (8 — all except custom_reports.execute/manage), technician (reports.view + dashboard_widgets.view), support (reports.view + dashboard_widgets.view), readonly (reports.view + dashboard_widgets.view + custom_reports.view).

> **Migration 312 — Scheduled Reports Task (§15.5):** `312_seed_scheduled_reports_task.sql` seeds `generate_scheduled_reports` (task_type=other, cron `0 * * * *` — hourly) dispatched by `scheduledReportService.processScheduledReports()`. Finds enabled schedules where next_run_at <= NOW(), generates report data via `reportService`, formats as CSV/XLSX/PDF, inserts a `generated_reports` history row, emails recipients via `emailTransport`, and advances next_run_at.

> **Migration 313 — Report Definitions Seed (§15 fix):** `313_seed_report_definitions.sql` populates `report_definitions` with 34 built-in report rows (organization_id=NULL, is_system=1) covering all slugs dispatched by `scheduledReportService.generateReportData()`: financial (aging, financial, revenue-by-period/plan/region/agent, cash-flow, payment-methods, churn-revenue, agent-commissions, tax-summary, sat-export), operational (technicians, subscriber-growth, subscriber-counts, arpu, uptime-by-area, mttr, installation-completion), network (bandwidth-utilization, top-consumers, congested-links, sfp-lifespan, optical-degradation, device-reboots, snmp-poll-success, alert-frequency, capacity-forecast, pon-utilization), and compliance (data-retention-compliance, ip-assignment-log, subscriber-identity, interception-readiness, regulatory-export). Activates the previously orphaned `reports.generate` and `reports.manage_definitions` permissions: `POST /reports/generate` runs a report on-demand (records in generated_reports); `POST /scheduled-reports/:id/run` manually triggers a schedule; `GET|POST /report-definitions` and `GET|PUT|DELETE /report-definitions/:id` provide CRUD for the registry.

> **Migration 314-322 — Regulatory Compliance (Mexico):** subscriber_consents, dsar_requests, identity_verification_records, gov_data_requests, phone_number_inventory, number_portability_records, numbering_blocks, uso_obligations, rural_coverage_reports, service_modification_notices, data_residency_config, report_access_logs; §16.2-16.9 regulatory compliance workflow.

> **Migrations 237–240 — §4 PPPoE Management Phase B (Service Profiles, Diagnostics, Permissions):**
> `237_create_pppoe_service_profiles.sql` creates `pppoe_service_profiles` table and adds guarded `service_profile_id` columns to `ip_pools` and `radius` (both FK→pppoe_service_profiles ON DELETE SET NULL). `238_create_radpostauth.sql` adds `radpostauth` table (no FKs — FreeRADIUS writes directly). `239_create_pppoe_event_logs.sql` adds `pppoe_event_logs` table (no FKs on organization_id/nas_id for loose-coupling syslog ingest). `240_seed_pppoe_phase_b_permissions.sql` seeds 6 RBAC permissions (`pppoe_service_profiles.view/create/update/delete`, `pppoe.diagnostics`, `pppoe.events_ingest`) and registers the `scan_auth_failures` scheduled task (every 15 min). New services: `pppoeDiagnosticsService` with `classifyAuthFailures()` (org-scoped radpostauth query, reason classification: bad_password/unknown_user/session_limit/no_pool/other), `detectMtuIssues()` (profile MTU > 1492 advisory + heuristic LCP-failure/MTU-mismatch advisory), `scanAuthFailures()` (scheduler handler, emits `pppoe.auth_failures` events). `syncFreeradiusTables()` extended: loads active service profiles per org, determines effective profile per subscriber (account-level `service_profile_id` overrides pool-level), emits `Framed-MTU`, `MS-Primary-DNS-Server`, `MS-Secondary-DNS-Server`, `Session-Timeout`, `Idle-Timeout`, `Filter-Id`, `Mikrotik-Address-List`, and `Mikrotik-Rate-Limit` radreply rows. RouterOS log line parser `parseRouterOsLogLine()` handles PADI/PADS/LCP/IPCP/AUTH/PADT patterns. New API endpoints: full CRUD under `/pppoe-service-profiles` + restore; `GET /pppoe/diagnostics/auth-failures`, `GET /pppoe/diagnostics/mtu-issues`, `GET /pppoe/events` (JWT auth); `POST /pppoe/events` (M2M secret auth via `X-Pppoe-Secret` header or `Authorization: Bearer`). Env vars: `PPPOE_EVENTS_SECRET` (M2M secret, falls back to `RADIUS_ACCOUNTING_SECRET`).

> **Migration 455 — PPPoE diagnostics telemetry:** Adds `organization_id`, `nas_id`, and explicit `reason_code` metadata plus supporting indexes to `radpostauth`; adds the nullable SHA-256 `source_key` and unique `(nas_id, source_key)` dedupe key to `pppoe_event_logs`; and registers one global `poll_pppoe_events` task at `*/5 * * * *`. Embedded-RADIUS accept/reject outcomes are logged best-effort without storing passwords, diagnostics filter directly on the owning organization, and MTU correlations retain tenant predicates throughout. Global authentication-failure scans cover shared-primary tenants plus every active isolated tenant database; the primary pass excludes stale isolated-tenant copies and a failed database scope does not stop the remaining scopes.

> **Migration 456 — NAS maintenance mode:** Adds `nas.maintenance_mode`, allowing an operator to keep a NAS active for subscriber service and manual management while excluding it from automatic RouterOS PPPoE diagnostics polling and readiness coverage. Existing NAS devices default to normal polling. The diagnostics banner reports maintained NAS separately so planned work and lab placeholders do not create false coverage warnings.

> **Migration 457 — Tenant-safe connection logging and IP attribution:** Makes `connection_logs` an organization-scoped mutable current/final session projection, adds stable lifecycle identity/receipt/retention and usage-baseline fields, and creates `radius_accounting_events`, `radius_accounting_usage_daily`, collector provenance, and privacy-minimal CGNAT binding/case-evidence controls. It adds tenant-bound accounting and CGNAT-ingest permissions, separate case-gated IP-attribution access/export permissions, selected lifecycle-milestone evidence, operational counter-delta rollups, creation-only partition maintenance, and 24-calendar-month product defaults. It stores no destination or content history. Shared-primary organizations still require installation-wide-unique active NAS addresses and RADIUS usernames because source-only listeners and stock FreeRADIUS compatibility tables are globally keyed; physically isolated tenant databases may reuse them. Apply migration 457 to every active isolated tenant database with `MIGRATE_ISOLATED_TENANTS=true`; large partitioned-table alters/backfills require a verified backup and real-MySQL migration/rollback rehearsal. During that maintenance window, pause/drain all accounting/CGNAT writers, verify collector retry/queue behavior, migrate the primary and every active isolated database, confirm the ownership/evidence triggers, and only then resume writers. MySQL cannot make the projection alteration and trigger installation atomic.

> **Migration 458 — Mexico SNII infrastructure-report preparation:** Adds the MX-only, tenant-scoped SNII applicability, asset-classification, two-person approval, immutable full-load batch, deterministic artifact, filing-evidence, and access-audit records. This is a preparation and evidence workflow; it does not submit to the CRT Ventanilla or establish authority acceptance. Apply migration 458 to every active isolated MX tenant database with `MIGRATE_ISOLATED_TENANTS=true`. The rollback intentionally retains these restricted evidence tables and permission definitions so a code rollback cannot destroy filing history.

> **Migration 459 — Working SNMP trap forwarding:** Activates tenant-scoped trap-rule matching and durable asynchronous delivery to exactly one email, public HTTPS URL, or same-organization saved webhook. Trap receipt and matching delivery rows are committed atomically, while bounded retries use ownership-safe claims. It also adds safe public-address DNS pinning, privacy-minimal payloads, test deliveries, delivery retention, authoritative duplicate-source-IP fail-closed attribution, per-source/per-organization/install-wide ingest and fan-out budgets, metadata-only trap lists, and a separately granted raw-varbind permission (seeded only to admin/super-admin); SNMP communities are never retained. Unknown, ambiguous, or unverifiable source traps are dropped without database persistence. Source attribution is enabled only for a single-organization shared-database installation. If the install retains more than one organization or any physically isolated tenant database configuration, forwarding fails closed until an install-operator-controlled primary source-binding registry can make ownership authoritative and atomic. Migration 459 is a stop/drain upgrade, not a rolling-compatible migration: stop all old application pods, workers, and UDP listeners, run it against the primary and every retained isolated database, then start only the new image. All legacy rules are paused during upgrade so an operator must review, test, and explicitly re-enable destinations that older releases stored but never executed. Legacy plaintext saved-webhook HMAC secrets are irreversibly cleared and those webhooks are paused; rotate and re-enter their secrets through the upgraded editor before re-enabling them. See the [operator guide](docs/snmp-trap-forwarding.md).

> **Migration 460 — Email settings and client communication hardening:** Makes stored organization SMTP passwords strictly authenticated AES-GCM envelopes, discards malformed/legacy plaintext credentials, binds affirmative marketing consent to the client's current email or phone identity, and persists the server-owned message class plus organization lifecycle epoch on outbound queues. Client DND is the delivery veto for every client-directed email, SMS, and WhatsApp message; marketing also requires fresh affirmative channel consent. Client-directed delivery now requires authoritative organization ownership; NULL-organization clients fail closed until an operator explicitly reconciles their tenant rather than risking reassignment of an orphan from a hard-deleted organization. Deploy migration 460 using the same stop/drain boundary as migration 459: stop old HTTP pods and outbound workers, set `MIGRATE_ISOLATED_TENANTS=true`, migrate the primary and every retained isolated tenant database, then start only the new image. Old workers do not understand destination epochs or message classes and must not overlap this migration. Existing active marketing grants are deliberately withdrawn so they cannot silently authorize a changed destination; collect fresh consent before sending new marketing communication.

> **Migration 461 — GUI-controlled WireGuard activation:** Moves the installation-wide hub switch into the operator-only Settings page. The public app remains non-root and delegates kernel networking to an isolated helper with only `NET_ADMIN`; a one-time compatibility sentinel preserves an existing deployment's enabled/disabled behavior.

> **Migration 463 — Mimosa PTP SNMP monitoring:** Replaces the inaccurate catch-all Mimosa template with separate system profiles for B-series PTP radios (1.x firmware/MIB branch) and C5c radios in PTP mode (2.x branch). Existing assignments to the global legacy profile are preserved by renaming it in place; tenant-owned profiles with the same name are untouched. The profiles use Mimosa's current B5/C5 product MIB for temperature, total received signal, chain-1 noise/SNR, and short-window Tx/Rx throughput plus IF-MIB/IF-X-MIB interface health and 64-bit octet counters. Chain 1 is explicit because an unfiltered all-chain average can include the MIB's invalid-chain sentinel. The poller now decodes exactly representable Counter64 values, the RF fields flow through raw/hourly/daily history and alert evaluation, and all RF plus interface-status columns are populated through hourly, daily, and monthly rollups. Exact deployed C5c PTP firmware still requires a live walk; CCQ, airtime, and GPS objects are deliberately not guessed.

> **Migrations 235–236 — §4.1 PPPoE Management Phase A (Pool Enhancements, Permissions):**
> `235_ip_pools_pppoe_enhancements.sql` adds five guarded columns to `ip_pools`: `nas_id` (FK→nas, for NAS-pool binding), `service_type` ENUM, `default_prefix_len` (IPv6 PD), `excluded_ranges` TEXT, and `last_alerted_threshold` TINYINT (utilization crossing tracker). `236_seed_pppoe_management_permissions.sql` seeds five RBAC permissions (`ip_pools.assign`, `ip_pools.utilization`, `ip_pools.binding_report`, `connection_logs.summary`, `radius.batch_disconnect`) with role assignments, and registers the `check_pool_utilization` hourly scheduled task.

> **Migrations 230–234 — §3.3+§3.4 RADIUS/AAA Phase C (Accounting, CoA hardening, NAS health):**
> `230_radius_accounting_ingest_columns.sql` adds 6 columns to `connection_logs` via stored-procedure guards (partitioned table): `acct_session_id` (Acct-Session-Id), `nas_port_id`, `called_station_id`, `calling_station_id`, `framed_ip`, `framed_ipv6_prefix`; adds index on `acct_session_id`. `231_create_mac_move_events.sql` adds `mac_move_events` table (no FK constraints — loose refs for compliance). `232_nas_registry_enhancements.sql` adds `coa_port`, `location`, `site_id` (FK→sites SET NULL), `secondary_nas_id` (self-ref FK SET NULL), `health_status`, `last_health_check_at` to `nas`. `233_radius_accounting_retention_setting.sql` seeds `purge_radius_accounting` (daily 03:00) and `nas_health_check` (*/5 * * * *) scheduled tasks. `234_seed_radius_accounting_permissions.sql` seeds `radius.accounting_ingest`, `radius.cdr_export`, `radius.coa`, `radius.mac_move_events.view`, `nas.health` RBAC permissions.
> New services: `radiusAccountingService` (ingest Start/Stop/Interim-Update into connection_logs with Gigawords wraparound handling, MAC move detection + synthesised stop rows, CDR export JSON/CSV, retention purge); `radiusCoaEncoder` (RFC 2865 byte-level encoding for User-Name, Framed-IP-Address, VSA type 26 — MikroTik vendor 14988 attrs 8+19, Cisco vendor 9 attr 1); `nasHealthService` (RADIUS Status-Server code 12 probes with Message-Authenticator, up/down transition events). `suspensionService.sendRadiusPacket` upgraded: extra attributes via `encodeNamedAttributes`, secondary NAS failover when primary `sent=false`. New endpoints: `POST /radius/accounting` (compatibility machine-to-machine path whose shared secret and globally unique NAS address resolve tenant ownership), `GET /radius/cdr` (audit-logged CDR export with `?from=&to=&username=&format=csv|json`); `POST /radius/coa` (dynamic per-subscriber CoA with named attributes); `GET /radius/mac-move-events` (paginated MAC move log); `GET/POST /nas/:id/health[-check]`. Migration 457 adds the recommended tenant-bound `POST /radius/accounting/tenant` path and changes the current accounting-retention default to 24 calendar months. FreeRADIUS REST configuration is documented in `docs/freeradius/README.md`.

> **Migrations 225–229 — §3.2 RADIUS/AAA Phase B (Authorization Gaps):**
> `225_radius_authorization_plan_columns.sql` adds `session_timeout_seconds`, `idle_timeout_seconds`, `simultaneous_use` (default 1) to `plans`, and `simultaneous_use` (NULL=inherit plan), `vlan_id`, `inner_vlan_id` to `radius`; seeds `kick_duplicate_sessions` scheduled task (every 5 min). `226_create_plan_access_windows.sql` adds the `plan_access_windows` table (day_mask + time window, mirroring `plan_speed_windows`). `227_walled_garden_and_suspension_action.sql` adds `organization_walled_garden_settings` and extends `suspension_rules.action` ENUM with `walled_garden`. `228_create_radius_account_routes.sql` adds `radius_account_routes` for per-account `Framed-Route` injection. `229_seed_radius_authz_permissions.sql` seeds RBAC permissions for `plan_access_windows.*`, `radius_account_routes.*`, `walled_garden.*`, `radius.kick_sessions`. Sync now emits: `Session-Timeout` / `Idle-Timeout` in radgroupreply; `Login-Time` in radgroupcheck from access windows (serialized by `radiusLoginTimeService`); `Simultaneous-Use :=` in radcheck (account override wins); `Tunnel-Type`, `Tunnel-Medium-Type`, `Tunnel-Private-Group-Id` in radreply for VLAN assignment (plus `:1` tag for QinQ); `Mikrotik-Address-List` in radreply for walled subscribers; `Framed-Route +=` per route row. New `walledGardenSuspendContract()` / `walledGardenReconnect()` functions handle CoA + suspension log + immediate re-sync. New `kickDuplicateSessions()` finds over-limit subscribers and disconnects oldest sessions via existing Disconnect-Request path. New API endpoints: `GET/POST /plans/:id/access-windows`, `PUT/DELETE /plans/:id/access-windows/:windowId`; `GET/POST /radius/:id/routes`, `PUT/DELETE /radius/:id/routes/:routeId`; `GET/PUT /radius/walled-garden`; `POST /radius/kick-sessions`. Walled garden NAS-side setup documented in `docs/freeradius/README.md`.

> **Migrations 223–224 — §3.1 RADIUS/AAA Phase A:**
> `223_create_freeradius_standard_tables.sql` adds the five standard FreeRADIUS SQL tables (`radcheck`, `radreply`, `radusergroup`, `radgroupcheck`, `radgroupreply`) required by FreeRADIUS `rlm_sql`; adds `auth_method ENUM('pppoe','mac','dot1x','eap_tls')` to the `radius` table (stored-procedure guard); creates the `subscriber_certificates` table for EAP-TLS certificate metadata; and seeds the `check_certificate_expiry` scheduled task (daily 06:00). `radiusService.syncFreeradiusTables()` materializes these tables from VigaBSS state — radcheck rows are auth-method-aware (Cleartext-Password for PPPoE/dot1x/EAP-TLS, Auth-Type or MAC-as-password for MAB, TLS-Cert-Serial for EAP-TLS), radgroupreply rows carry vendor speed attributes from `radiusAttributeService`. MAB password mode is configurable via org setting `mab_password_mode`. `224_seed_radius_aaa_permissions.sql` seeds `subscriber_certificates.*` and `radius.sync` RBAC permissions. New endpoints: `POST /radius/sync-freeradius`, full CRUD under `/subscriber-certificates` plus `POST /subscriber-certificates/:id/revoke`, `GET /subscriber-certificates/radius-account/:id`, `GET /subscriber-certificates/client/:id`. FreeRADIUS setup guide in `docs/freeradius/`.

> **Migrations 217–222 — §2.5 (Refund Requests, Disputes, Chargebacks, Billing Adjustments):**
> Adds `refund_requests` table (217) with status lifecycle `requested → under_review → approved/rejected → processed`; RBAC seeds (218); `billing_disputes` + `dispute_evidence` tables (219) with multipart evidence upload reusing the existing upload middleware; dispute RBAC seeds (220); `chargebacks` + `billing_adjustments` tables (221); chargeback/adjustment RBAC seeds (222). `paymentGatewayService.handleWebhookEvent` now auto-creates a chargeback row when a dispute webhook is received. `billingAdjustmentService.record()` is called from refund processing and mirrors each adjustment into `audit_logs`. New events: `refund.requested` (webhook dispatch to billing staff), `refund.processed` (email to client + webhook).

> **Migrations 211–216 — §2.3+§2.4 (Payment Plans, Cash Reconciliation, Soft Suspension, Suspension Exempt):**
> Adds payment plan / installment management (211–212), cash reconciliation sessions (213–214), soft-suspend ENUM + speed columns on suspension_rules (215), and suspension_exempt columns on clients (216).

> **Migrations 204–210 — Billing & Subscription Management Phase B (§2.2B):** `204_create_organization_invoice_settings.sql` adds the `organization_invoice_settings` table for per-org invoice branding (logo URL, header color, footer legal text, payment instructions); `pdfService.generateInvoicePdf` now reads these settings. `205_seed_invoice_settings_permissions.sql` seeds `invoice_settings.view` and `invoice_settings.update`. `206_create_late_fee_tables.sql` adds `late_fee_rules` and `invoice_late_fees` tables and seeds the `apply_late_fees` scheduled task (daily 02:00). `207_seed_late_fee_permissions.sql` seeds `late_fees.view` and `late_fees.manage`. `208_create_payment_reminder_tables.sql` adds `payment_reminder_settings` and `payment_reminder_logs` tables and seeds the `send_payment_reminders` scheduled task (hourly). `209_seed_payment_reminder_permissions.sql` seeds `payment_reminders.view` and `payment_reminders.manage`. `210_seed_tax_report_permissions.sql` seeds `billing.tax_reports`. New endpoints: `GET/PUT /invoice-settings`, `GET/POST/PUT/DELETE /late-fee-rules`, `GET/PUT /payment-reminder-settings`, `GET /billing/tax-reports`, `GET /invoices/:id/receipt`, `GET /payments/:id/receipt`.

> **Migrations 200–203 — Plan billing features (§2.1):** `200_plan_billing_features.sql` adds ten columns to `plans` (`radius_vendor`, `radius_rate_limit_template`, `fup_threshold_gb`, `fup_threshold_percent`, `fup_download_speed_mbps`, `fup_upload_speed_mbps`, `overage_mode`, `overage_price_per_gb`, `trial_days`, `trial_price`) and creates `plan_throttle_logs` for FUP throttle audit; seeds `check_fup_thresholds` (every 15 min) and `convert_expired_trials` (hourly) scheduled tasks. `201_create_plan_speed_windows.sql` adds the `plan_speed_windows` table for time-based speed scheduling and seeds the `apply_speed_windows` task (every 5 min). `202_extend_plan_addons_enum.sql` extends `plan_addons.addon_type` with `voip` and `iptv` values. `203_seed_plan_feature_permissions.sql` seeds `plans.radius_attributes`, `plans.speed_windows`, and `plans.fup_throttle` RBAC permissions with role assignments.

> **Migrations 198–199 — Communication campaigns and DND (§1.4):** `198_create_communication_tables.sql` adds the `communication_campaigns`, `campaign_messages`, and `client_dnd_preferences` tables; adds `campaign_message_id` and `opened_at` columns to `email_logs`; adds `campaign_message_id` to `sms_logs`; and seeds the `campaign_send` scheduled task (`*/5 * * * *`) that processes queued campaign messages. `199_seed_communication_permissions.sql` seeds the `communication` RBAC module permissions (`campaigns.*`, `dnd.view`, `dnd.update`) and assigns them to the default roles.

> **Migrations 196–197 — Interaction tracking (§1.3):** `196_create_interaction_tracking_tables.sql` adds the `client_interactions`, `follow_up_reminders`, `satisfaction_surveys`, and `ticket_escalations` tables and seeds three scheduled tasks: `follow_up_reminders` (notify assignees of due follow-ups, every 15 min), `dispatch_satisfaction_surveys` (auto-send CSAT surveys for resolved tickets, hourly), and `auto_escalate_tickets` (escalate tickets unresolved after 48 h, hourly). `197_seed_interaction_permissions.sql` seeds the `interactions` RBAC module permissions (`interactions.*`, `follow_ups.*`, `surveys.*`, `escalations.*`) and assigns them to the default roles. New endpoints: full CRUD under `/interactions`, `/follow-up-reminders` (plus `GET /follow-up-reminders/due`, `POST /follow-up-reminders/:id/complete`), `/satisfaction-surveys` (plus `GET /satisfaction-surveys/metrics`, `POST /satisfaction-surveys/:id/{send,respond}`), `/escalations` (plus `GET /escalations/candidates`, `POST /escalations/:id/transition`), and the unified timeline at `GET /clients/:id/timeline`. New event-bus events with email/SSE/webhook hooks: `followup.due`, `survey.requested`, `ticket.escalated`.

> **Migrations 193–194 — Customer lifecycle (§1.2):** `193_create_customer_lifecycle_tables.sql` adds the `leads`, `service_orders`, `service_order_tasks`, and `winback_campaigns` tables. `194_seed_lifecycle_permissions.sql` seeds the `lifecycle` RBAC module permissions (`leads.*`, `service_orders.*`, `winback.*`, `lifecycle.view`) and assigns them to the default roles. New endpoints: full CRUD under `/leads` (plus `GET /leads/pipeline`, `POST /leads/:id/convert`), `/service-orders` (plus `GET/POST/PATCH /service-orders/:id/tasks`), `/winback-campaigns` (plus `GET /winback-campaigns/:id/targets`), and lifecycle analytics under `/lifecycle/churn` and `/lifecycle/at-risk`.

> **Migration 401 — Multi-core CPU averaging + RAM-matched memory percentage:** `401_snmp_cpu_average_and_memory_ratio.sql` ships the deferred proper fix migration 398 punted on. 398 fixed a crash (`hrStorageUsed`, a raw HOST-RESOURCES-MIB storage-allocation-unit count, was seeded as a bare scalar GET straight into the SMALLINT `memory_usage` "percentage" column and overflowed it) by simply removing `memory_usage` collection for the two profiles that had it. Separately, `hrProcessorLoad` (also HOST-RESOURCES-MIB, table-indexed by `hrDeviceIndex` under `hrProcessorTable`) is seeded as a bare scalar GET into `cpu_usage` for three profiles (migration 031's `'Generic IF-MIB'`/`'MikroTik RouterOS'`, migration 252's `'Generic Switch'`) — on real hardware a bare GET against a table OID returns `NoSuchName`; `snmpGet()`'s varbind-error check already skips that safely (never crashed a poll), but `cpu_usage` has silently never populated for any device on those profiles. Live-verified against a real RouterOS lab device (net-snmp): `hrProcessorTable` must be walked (one row per core); `hrStorageTable`'s `hrStorageType`/`hrStorageUsed`/`hrStorageSize` walks correlate by a shared trailing `hrStorageIndex` (same pattern as per-interface `ifIndex` correlation) — the row whose `hrStorageType` equals `hrStorageRam` gave `(used/size)*100` = 300924/1048576 = **28.70%**, a believable percentage (proof this is a real fix, not removed-and-forgotten), with a `hrStorageFixedDisk` row present in the same walk and correctly ignored. Adds `snmp_profile_oids.aggregate BOOLEAN NOT NULL DEFAULT FALSE` (only meaningful when `is_per_interface=TRUE`): generic/data-driven — "walk this OID's subtree and reduce every row to one averaged device-level value," reusable for any future averaged multi-instance metric, not hardcoded to CPU. Data-driven `UPDATE ... WHERE oid='1.3.6.1.2.1.25.3.3.1.2' AND metric_column='cpu_usage'` sets `is_per_interface=TRUE, aggregate=TRUE`, automatically covering all three affected profiles without naming them. Re-seeds `memory_usage` (`NOT EXISTS`-guarded) for the two profiles migration 398 stripped it from; that row's `oid` is label-only — `src/services/snmpPoller.js`'s new `collectHrMemoryPercent()` hardcodes and walks the three real OIDs itself, deliberately **not** a generic mechanism (per CLAUDE.md's guidance against building one for a pattern used exactly once — `snmp_profile_oids.transform` can only express a single-value expression, not a two-OID ratio filtered to one matching row). New `collectTableAverage(session, oid)` walks and averages for the generic `aggregate=TRUE` path. `pollDevice()`'s `is_per_interface` OIDs now split into three dispatch buckets (memory_usage → `collectHrMemoryPercent`, `aggregate=TRUE` → `collectTableAverage`, everything else → the original `pollInterfaces()` path); both new paths fold into the same single device-level `scalarRow`/`insertMetricRow()` call and count toward `agentResponded` (migration 398's reachability boolean) on completion regardless of row count or RAM-row match, mirroring `pollInterfaces()`'s "a completed walk is still evidence the agent replied" semantics. **Investigation finding:** migration 252's `'Generic Switch'` profile shares the same silent-never-populates `cpu_usage` bug (fixed here automatically) but never seeded a `memory_usage` OID at all, so there was no live-crashing-poll residual from it to fix. Two adjacent bugs fixed in the same PR: `SnmpProfile.addOid()` silently dropped `transform` (column existed, scalar transforms depended on it) and now also persists `aggregate`; `middleware/schemas/snmpProfiles.js`'s `createSnmpProfileOid` didn't declare `metric_column`/`is_per_interface`/`aggregate`/`sort_order` even though `addOid()` reads them straight off `req.body` — now validated (`metric_column` required).

> **Migration 400 — Time-bound maintenance-window suppression + membership-aware staff recipient resolution:** Two independent notification-pipeline fixes.
> **Fix A (maintenance windows never expired):** `activeMaintenanceWindowId()` (`alertService.js`) and `GET /alerts/maintenance-windows/active` (`routes/alerts.js`) both used to trust `status = 'active'` unconditionally — the time-bound `starts_at`/`ends_at` check only ran for `status = 'scheduled'`. Since nothing ever transitioned a window out of `'active'` automatically (the Edit form lets status be set freely) a window someone left at `'active'` suppressed alerts forever, even long after `ends_at`. Both predicates now require `status IN ('active','scheduled')` **and** `starts_at <= NOW() AND ends_at >= NOW()` unconditionally. `400_seed_maintenance_window_expiry_task.sql` seeds the `maintenance_window_expiry` scheduled task (global, `*/15 * * * *`, priority `low`, same `INSERT...SELECT...WHERE NOT EXISTS` idempotency as migration 138) calling the new `alertService.expireMaintenanceWindows()` (`UPDATE maintenance_windows SET status='completed' WHERE status IN ('scheduled','active') AND ends_at < NOW()`, org-scoped when the task dispatch supplies an `organizationId`, global sweep otherwise — mirrors `taskRunner.js`'s `handleSlaBreachCheck`/`handleInventoryLowStockCheck` optional-org-filter shape). **`recurrence_cron`/`is_recurring` remain captured-but-unimplemented** — completing a window does NOT materialize its next occurrence; do not assume this task creates new windows. **Behavior change:** any operator relying on a hand-set `'active'` status to suppress alerts indefinitely loses that — suppression now never outlives `ends_at`.
> **Fix B (staff notification recipients used the wrong role source):** `notificationHooks.js`'s `resolveStaffRecipients()` and three inline recipient queries (`outage.reported`, `outage.resolved`, `ip_pool.threshold`) queried `users.role` directly — the legacy column that `User.getPermissions`/RBAC treats as a **fallback only**, applied when a user has no `organization_users` membership row for the org. A staffer whose real access came from an `organization_users` membership (with a different or no legacy `users.role`) was silently excluded from every bell/email notification in this file — and, per this exact README's own migration-397 note above, this was previously **flagged as a known inconsistency, not fixed**. This migration fixes it: new `User.getStaffByEffectiveRole(organizationId, roles)` (`src/models/User.js`) resolves recipients the RBAC-authoritative way — `organization_users` membership role for the target org when a membership row exists, else the legacy `users.role` fallback for users homed in the org (mirrors `getUsersWithPermission`'s `LEFT JOIN organization_users` shape, keyed on role name instead of permission slug). All four notification sites now call it via `resolveStaffRecipients()`. Two side effects, both intentional: (1) the query has **no `email IS NOT NULL` filter** — a staffer with no email on file now still gets an in-app bell row (previously silently excluded from bell notifications too, not just email); every call site's email leg is gated on `if (recipient.email)` to compensate. (2) cross-org members (homed in another organization, holding a membership row here) are now included, matching `getUsersWithPermission`'s existing precedent. **Also corrects a stale doc claim:** `'support'` has been a valid `organization_users.role` ENUM value since migration 378 — it is not legacy-`users.role`-only as CLAUDE.md currently states. No schema/permission/OpenAPI changes for Fix B.
>
> **Migration 399 — Readonly can actually see the app (frontend gate fix + missing view grants):** `399_grant_readonly_missing_view_permissions.sql` grants role `readonly` 16 previously-missing `.view`/`.read` permission slugs, closing a gap left by migration 119's one-time `%.view`/`%.export` blanket grant (a snapshot over the ~17 permissions that existed at that moment — every `.view` permission added by a *later* migration needed its own explicit readonly grant, and three whole modules never got one): §18 automation (`automation_rules.view`, `batch_jobs.view`, `provisioning_pipelines.view`, `remediation_rules.view`, `automation_scripts.view`, `script_executions.view`), §19 resellers (`resellers.view`), §20 integrations (`integration_providers.view`, `integration_connections.view`, `integration_sync_logs.view`), plus six one-off misses (`pppoe.diagnostics`, `cpe_profiles.view`, `billing.tax_reports`, `dsar_requests.view`, `ai.policy.read`, `support.conversations.view`). No schema.sql change — pure `role_permissions` data, no DDL, following the same precedent as migrations 377/393/394 (whose grant-only INSERTs also aren't mirrored into schema.sql). Deliberately preserves two pre-existing, explicitly-reasoned exclusions rather than overriding them: migration 377's credential-bearing carve-out (`api_tokens.view`, `webhooks.view`, `device_config_backups.view`, `payment_gateways.view`, `pac_providers.view`, `csd_certificates.view` stay ungranted) and migration 335's "no security permissions for readonly — principle of least privilege" (all of §17 stays ungranted); `wireguard.peers.admin`, `router_driver_configs.view` (it also guards `POST /router-drivers/:id/test`, which decrypts stored router credentials, opens a live device connection, and writes `last_tested_at`/`last_test_status` — caught in review), and the reseller sub-resource `.manage`/`.approve` slugs also stay ungranted because they conflate view with mutation and have no separate view-only variant. Paired with a frontend fix (`frontend/src/auth/PrivateRoute.tsx`): `hasRole()` was keyed `'read-only'` while the real `users.role` ENUM value is `'readonly'` (rank always resolved to 0), and even correctly spelled, rank 1 sat below every `requiredRole` gate — readonly was locked out of nearly every page regardless of what it was granted. `hasRole()` now gives `readonly` an explicit bypass (mirrors the `admin` bypass), so it passes every `requiredRole` gate and reaches every page; `frontend/src/nav/routes.ts`'s `canSee()` already had a `readonly`-sees-everything bypass past its `roles[]` allowlist (added when the nav registry was built) that was unreachable until this fix. Net effect: readonly's resolved nav tree is now identical to admin's. Numbering note: authored as 399 while migration 398 (a concurrent SNMP PR) was still unmerged — rebase onto 398 once it lands.
>
> **Migration 398 — Remove broken `memory_usage` OID seed; guarantee a scalar reachability anchor:** `398_fix_memory_usage_seed_and_seed_reachability_oid.sql` deletes the `1.3.6.1.2.1.25.2.3.1.6` (hrStorageUsed) → `memory_usage` seed rows migration 031 shipped for the `'Generic IF-MIB'` and `'MikroTik RouterOS'` profiles: hrStorageUsed is a raw storage-allocation-unit count, never a percentage on its own (it needs dividing by a second OID, hrStorageSize, to become one) — a device reporting e.g. `302552` (≈28.9% of a ~1GB device in its native units) blew the SMALLINT `memory_usage` column's range, threw a MySQL "Out of range" error, and rejected the *entire* `pollDevice()` call: the device was recorded as a poll **failure** (eventually flipping to `'offline'` via migration 397's threshold) even though it answered SNMP perfectly, and per-interface metrics were never attempted for that cycle — one bad seed row, three symptoms. `memory_usage` collection stops for these two profiles until a proper two-OID ratio feature ships (deferred — `snmp_profile_oids.transform` is a single-value expression and can't express hrStorageUsed/hrStorageSize). The migration also re-applies migration 372's idempotent sysUpTime backfill (`NOT EXISTS`-guarded) so any profile lacking a scalar OID gets one. `src/services/snmpPoller.js` hardening in the same PR: per-column bounds validation before every `INSERT` (out-of-range/non-finite values are nulled + `logger.warn`, never thrown — the row still inserts with its surviving columns); `snmp_profile_oids.transform` is now read and applied (whitelisted `value / N` / `value * N` forms only — no `eval`/`Function`); the scalar metrics `INSERT` is decoupled from per-interface polling (an ingest/DB error can no longer masquerade as "device unreachable"); and `pollDevice()`/`pollerEngine.pollWithConfig()` now require at least one real varbind response (scalar or per-interface, presence-based — a `sysUpTime=0` from a freshly-rebooted device still counts) before calling a poll successful, throwing `Error('device unreachable: no OIDs responded')` otherwise. Flagged, not fixed: migration 258's `snmp_adaptive_poll_check`/`poller_performance_snapshot` scheduled tasks have no `taskRunner.js` case and never run.
>
> **Migrations 396–397 — Wire alert/outage/device events into the bell+email pipeline; device online/offline detection; alert dedup:** Four previously-dead notification events (`outage.reported`/`resolved`, `device.offline`/`online`) and two previously-listener-less ones (`alert.triggered`, `alert.escalated`) now flow through the same in-app-bell + email pipeline as `work_order.assigned` (migration 395). `396_notifications_type_enum_alert_outage_device.sql` extends `notifications.type` with `'alert'`, `'outage'`, `'device'` (INFORMATION_SCHEMA-guarded, same idempotent pattern as 395). `397_add_consecutive_poll_failures_to_devices.sql` adds `devices.consecutive_poll_failures INT NOT NULL DEFAULT 0`, backing a brand-new `src/services/deviceStatusService.js` state machine: **>= 3 consecutive failed polls** flips a device to `'offline'` (unless already `'offline'` or `'maintenance'` — `'maintenance'` is never auto-flipped either direction) and emits `device.offline`; the next successful poll resets the counter. **First-deploy stampede guard:** every device defaults to `status='offline'` with 0 failures, so its first-ever successful poll still writes `status='online'` (the column now reflects reality) but emits nothing — `device.online` only fires when the prior offline state actually crossed the failure threshold. Wired into both poll paths (`pollerEngine.js`'s `pollWithConfig()`, `snmpPoller.js`'s `poll()`), folded into the existing `last_polled_at`/`last_poll_error` UPDATE (one write, not two). **Alert dedup:** a sustained breach re-evaluated every 5-minute cron cycle previously re-emitted `alert.triggered` (and re-emailed staff) forever; `alertService.hasRecentAlertEpisode()` now gates the emit (not the `alert_events` history INSERT, which stays unconditional) in both `evaluateAlerts()` v1 and `evaluateAlertsV2()` — one notification per breach "episode", re-notifying only after 60+ quiet minutes since the last non-suppressed event for that rule+device. **`alert_rules.notification_channels`** (JSON, written by `POST/PUT /alert-rules` since it was added but never read by anything) is now honored by `alert.triggered`: email/webhook legs are gated per-rule, `null`/unparseable treated as "all enabled" for backward compatibility — **this is a behavior change for existing rules that had a `notification_channels` value nobody expected to matter.** Bell rows are always created regardless of channels (non-intrusive). `alert.escalated`'s external on-call step (`recipient_email`/`webhook_url`) is handled directly (no user lookup) — `sms`/`whatsapp`/`telegram` step channels log a "not implemented" warning rather than faking delivery (no SMS transport precedent for staff/on-call alerting in `notificationHooks.js`); the step's `webhook_url` itself is **not individually dispatched to** — `webhookService.dispatch()` only targets an organization's registered webhook subscriptions matched by event name, so escalation webhooks go out at the org level as the closest available approximation (flagged gap, not fixed). `outages.js`'s bare `crudController(Outage)` gained `afterCreate`/`beforeUpdate`/`afterUpdate` hooks emitting `outage.reported`/`outage.resolved` (the latter ONLY on the transition into `'resolved'` from a different prior status — an unrelated edit to an already-resolved outage does not re-emit); `alertService.autoCreateOutage()` (bypasses the route entirely) now emits `outage.reported` too. All new recipient-resolution queries (`alert.triggered`/`.escalated`'s admin/technician bell+email, `device.offline`/`.online`'s admin/technician set) follow this file's existing (legacy `users.role`, not the RBAC-authoritative `organization_users` membership role) precedent rather than introducing a third resolution path — flagged as a pre-existing inconsistency, not fixed here. `device.offline`'s bell/email leg is suppressed (broadcast/webhook still fire) when `alertService.isInMaintenanceWindow()` reports the device inside an active window. `NotificationBell.tsx`'s `entityRoute()` gained `'devices'` (→ `/devices/:id`) and `'outages'` (→ `/outages`, list-only — there is no outage detail route, mirroring the existing `'work_orders'` case). No new endpoints, no OpenAPI change. Not yet verified against a running install — redeploy required.

> **Migration 392 — Inventory follow-ups: items sellable on invoices/quotes + undo-install (§14.2 cont'd):** Two independent follow-ups from real usage.
> **Feature A (items sellable directly):** `GET /inventory/items` (`src/routes/inventory.js`) is now hand-rolled around `InventoryItem.findAllWithStock` instead of the generic `crudController.list` (which has no way to express a `JOIN`+`GROUP BY`), enriching every row with `quantity_on_hand` (`SUM(inventory_stock.quantity)` across all warehouses, one grouped query, no N+1 — same pattern as `Plan.getAddons`/migration 390). This also fixes the long-standing `InventoryManagement` Stock-tab bug where `quantity_on_hand` always rendered "—" (the field was simply never in the response before) and makes its low-stock banner fire for the first time. `InvoiceDetail.tsx`/`QuoteDetail.tsx`'s product picker (and `GenerateInvoiceModal.tsx`/`GenerateQuoteModal.tsx`'s Product line type) now show the **union** of the curated `plan_addons` catalog and active `inventory_items` not already linked by one of those addons (the curated addon wins on overlap) — an item's line price defaults to `sale_price ?? unit_cost ?? 0` (still editable) and sends `inventory_item_id` exactly like a linked addon does; serialized (`serial_required`) items sell by quantity here with no serial prompt (serial assignment stays the install flow's job). No schema change for this half — see `frontend/src/api/addonCatalog.ts`'s `buildProductPickerEntries`. Ride-along fix: `plan_addons.description` (column has existed since migration 111) is now accepted by `POST /plans/addons` — the create schema/route silently dropped it before.
> **Feature B (undo-install):** Adds `cpe_devices.sale_invoice_id BIGINT UNSIGNED NULL` (nullable FK → `invoices`, `ON DELETE SET NULL`) — the one-off invoice raised at install time when `ownership='sold'`; `inventorySerialService.installEquipment`'s sold branch now records it right after `billingService.createOneOffInvoice` returns. New `POST /cpe-management/devices/:id/uninstall` (`cpe_inventory.manage`, no new permission — reuses the slug migration 391 already granted to admin+technician) reverses a mistaken install on a still-**live** contract (distinct from the pickup flow, which owns post-*cancellation* returns): the unit must be `assigned`/`active` (422 with a "cancelled contract → use pickup" message otherwise); a unit that was actually **installed** (`inventory_item_id` AND `ownership` both set — `ownership` is only ever set by `installEquipment`, which always decrements, so it's the real signal that stock was taken; `inventory_item_id` alone is not, since `cpeInventoryService.linkSubscriber`/its TR-069 auto-link counterpart also assign a tracked unit without ever decrementing stock — a separate, pre-existing gap, out of this follow-up's scope) gets +1 stock restored with a `return` ledger row (mirrors whichever decrement install made — rented via a direct `assign_to_job` write, sold via `drawdownForSale` inside `createOneOffInvoice`); every other unit (untracked, or tracked-but-only-ever-subscriber-linked) just gets unassigned with zero stock/ledger writes. A **sold** unit additionally resolves the sale invoice: unpaid (`SUM(payment_allocations.amount) = 0`) → voided via the existing `billingService.voidInvoiceById` (called *before* the stock/unit reversal transaction, not inside it — that function isn't composable into an externally-supplied connection, and voiding first makes the whole operation retry-safe, since `voidInvoiceById` is idempotent); paid or partially paid → `422`, nothing written, the operator must resolve the payment (credit note/refund) first; `sale_invoice_id` `NULL` (installed before this migration) → the reversal proceeds and the response includes a `warnings: [...]` note that the sale invoice, if any, must be voided manually. Also extends `cpeInventoryService.TRANSITIONS['active']` with a direct `active → in_stock` path (previously only `assigned → in_stock` existed) — undo must work for a unit that already came online, not just one still `assigned`. Frontend: a shared `UndoInstallButton` (confirm dialog with name+serial, optional notes, verbatim backend error surfacing, warnings shown inline instead of auto-dismissed) wired into `ServiceOrderList.tsx`'s Equipment modal and `ClientDetail.tsx`'s Assigned Equipment section (which gained its first mutating action — previously read-only).
>
> **Migration 391 — Inventory Phase 3: per-serial units, install drawdown (rent/buy), pickup returns (§14.2 cont'd):** Serialized equipment tracking end to end. Adds `inventory_items.serial_required TINYINT(1) NOT NULL DEFAULT 0` (per-product toggle, default OFF — every existing pure-quantity Phase 1/2 flow is unchanged when it's off). Reuses the existing `cpe_devices` table (migration 274/278) as the per-serial unit registry rather than adding a new one: adds `cpe_devices.inventory_item_id` (nullable FK → `inventory_items`, `ON DELETE SET NULL`) and `cpe_devices.ownership ENUM('rented','sold') NULL` (set at install time); `cpe_devices.contract_id` already existed. Also **relaxes `cpe_devices.oui` from `NOT NULL` to `NULL`** — it was modelled as a mandatory TR-069 CWMP field, but Phase 3 mints units from PO receipts and manual registration where no OUI is known yet; forcing a placeholder would have corrupted that column's meaning for `acsService`/`cpeDiagnosticsService`. Extends `work_orders.work_type` with a `'pickup'` value — the auto-created technician follow-up when a contract with outstanding rented equipment is cancelled/terminated; no new table backs the checklist, it's computed live from `cpe_devices WHERE contract_id=? AND ownership='rented' AND lifecycle_state IN ('assigned','active')`. No new permission slugs — instead grants the **existing** (previously admin-only) `cpe_devices.view`/`.create` and `cpe_inventory.view`/`.manage` to `technician` (required for this feature's primary user — every `cpe_*` permission from migrations 276/278 had zero non-admin grants before this) and `cpe_devices.view`/`cpe_inventory.view`/`cpe_lifecycle_history.view` to `readonly`. `cpe_inventory.link`/`.swap` and `cpe_devices.update`/`.delete` remain admin-only (flagged, not fixed — out of scope). Also extends `cpeInventoryService.TRANSITIONS['assigned']` to allow a direct `assigned → rma` transition (a pickup can find a unit damaged before it was ever activated).
>
> **Consistency invariant** (enforced in `src/services/inventorySerialService.js`): for a `serial_required` item, `inventory_stock.quantity` counts ALL physical units including untracked legacy stock; tracked units (`cpe_devices` with a matching `inventory_item_id`, `lifecycle_state='in_stock'`) must never exceed it. Every state change that crosses the stock boundary (in_stock ↔ out) moves `quantity` and writes an `inventory_transactions` ledger row in the same transaction, org-scoped throughout.
>
> Backend: `POST /purchase-orders/:id/receive` (`src/routes/purchaseOrders.js`) accepts an optional `serials: { [lineItemId]: string[] }` — for a line whose item is `serial_required`, the array length must exactly equal that line's *incremental* delta for the call (matching `quantity_received`'s own "packing slip" semantics); validated in a pass over every line **before any write**, so a count mismatch 422s with the PO/stock/`cpe_devices` completely untouched. A matching serial array mints one `in_stock` `cpe_devices` row per serial in the same transaction as the existing stock increment/ledger write. `POST /cpe-management/devices/register` (`cpe_inventory.manage`) is the manual-add path for the CPE Inventory page's new **Register** tab — default "catch-up" registration never touches `inventory_stock.quantity` (for stock that predates the toggle); `increment_stock: true` additionally receives +1 against a caller-given `warehouse_id` (or the org's best-guess row) with a `receive` ledger row, for a genuinely new unit. `POST /cpe-management/devices/install` (`cpe_inventory.manage`) is the drawdown moment — picks an existing `in_stock` serial **or** registers a brand-new one on the fly ("type-a-new-serial", guarded: only allowed while `inventory_stock.quantity` for that item exceeds the count of already-tracked `in_stock` units), transitions it to `assigned` on the given contract, and decrements stock exactly once: `ownership='rented'` writes an `assign_to_job` ledger row directly (no invoice); `ownership='sold'` calls `billingService.createOneOffInvoice(..., inventoryItemId)` — extended in this migration to optionally tag its single `invoice_items` row with `inventory_item_id` and call `inventoryDrawdownService.drawdownForSale` (Phase 2's exact same helper, extracted into a shared `resolveOrCreateStockRow`) **inside that one call**, so `installEquipment` itself never also decrements for the sold case. Contract cancellation (`PATCH/PUT /contracts/:id` status→cancelled/terminated/expired, and `POST /contracts/:id/terminate`) fires a best-effort, idempotent `inventorySerialService.ensurePickupWorkOrder` hook — creates a `work_type='pickup'` work order only when the contract has outstanding `ownership='rented'` equipment, and only once (checked via an open, non-terminal existing pickup order for that contract). `GET/POST /work-orders/:id/pickup-items` (`work_orders.view`/`.update`) list/resolve the checklist — `returned` transitions the unit to `in_stock` (+1 stock, `return` ledger row, only when the unit has an `inventory_item_id`), `rma` transitions to `rma` with **no** stock/ledger write (it never crosses back into stock); the work order auto-completes once every outstanding rented unit on its contract is resolved. Sold devices are the client's property and never appear in a pickup checklist.
>
> Frontend: `InventoryList.tsx`'s item form gains a `serial_required` toggle (+ a "Serialized" badge in the list); `PurchaseOrderDetail.tsx`'s Receive modal shows a per-line serial textarea (one per line) for `serial_required` lines, with a live count vs. needed indicator that disables Confirm on mismatch. `CpeInventoryPage.tsx` gains a fifth **Register** tab (manual-add form + a filterable serial/product/state/client/ownership list — `GET /cpe-management/devices` gained `lifecycle_state`/`inventory_item_id`/`subscriber_id`/`contract_id` query filters and now joins in `item_name`/`item_sku`/`subscriber_name`). `ServiceOrderList.tsx` gains an **Equipment** button (shown once a contract is linked) opening a modal with a product picker, an in-stock-serial-or-type-new-serial toggle, and a rent/buy radio, calling the install endpoint. `WorkOrders.tsx` shows the pickup checklist (instead of the materials panel) for `work_type='pickup'` rows and hides the generic Complete button for them (completion is driven entirely by resolving every unit). `ClientDetail.tsx`'s Devices tab gains a read-only "Assigned Equipment" section (serial/product/state/ownership) fed by `subscriber_id`.
>
> **Follow-up items flagged, not fixed** (pre-existing, adjacent to this migration): `cpe_inventory.link`/`.swap` and `cpe_devices.update`/`.delete` are still admin-only, so a technician can view/register/install/pick-up equipment but still can't use the pre-existing Subscriber Link/Swap tabs or edit/delete a device record. `WorkOrders.tsx`'s per-row `<>...</>` fragment (pre-dates this migration) has no `key` prop — a harmless React dev-console warning, not a functional bug.

> **Migration 390 — Inventory Phase 2: product linkage + sale drawdown (§14.2 cont'd):** Adds nullable `inventory_item_id BIGINT UNSIGNED` FKs (`ON DELETE SET NULL`) to `plan_addons`, `invoice_items`, and `quote_items`, linking the invoice/quote "product" catalog to physical `inventory_items` rows. Also **drops** the migration-127 `trg_inventory_stock_negative_bu` trigger — the sale-drawdown policy below requires that invoicing a linked product never fails on a stock-count drift, so negative `inventory_stock.quantity` becomes an explicit, allowed state (rendered in red in the UI) instead of a blocking `SQLSTATE '45000'` error. No new tables (table count unchanged) and no new permissions (reuses `inventory.view`/`invoices.*`/`quotes.*`/`plans.*`). Backend: `POST /plans/addons`, `POST /invoices/:id/items`, and `POST /quotes/:id/items` now accept `inventory_item_id`, org-verified against `inventory_items` (422 on cross-org/nonexistent) — mirrors Phase 1's (`306_seed_inventory_asset_permissions.sql`) org-scoping checks. `GET /plans/addons/catalog` (`Plan.getAddons`) now `LEFT JOIN`s a `SUM(inventory_stock.quantity)` aggregate per addon so the invoice/quote product picker can show `quantity_on_hand` without N+1 queries. **Sale drawdown** (invoices only — quotes never draw down): when `POST /invoices/:id/items` receives an `inventory_item_id`, it opens a transaction that decrements the org's stock row with the *greatest quantity* for that item (deterministic v1 policy; creates a stock row at the org's first warehouse if none exists yet) and writes a `sell_to_client` row to `inventory_transactions` (`invoice_id`, `client_id` from the invoice, `performed_by`, `reference` = invoice number) — mirrors Phase 1's `POST /inventory/transactions` ledger INSERT column list exactly (`src/services/inventoryDrawdownService.js`). The non-inventory-linked add-item path is untouched (no transaction opened, same as before). `POST /quotes/:id/convert-to-invoice` carries each copied line's `inventory_item_id` into the new `invoice_items` row and runs the *same* drawdown helper inline, in the *same* transaction as the conversion's item inserts — it does not call `POST /invoices/:id/items` internally, so a converted line is drawn down exactly once. **No reversal path was built**: `invoice_items` has no `PUT`/`DELETE` route (items are append-only, mirroring `quote_items`), so there is nothing to reverse against; voiding an invoice does not touch stock either (pre-existing, unrelated to this migration — flagged, not fixed). New read endpoint `GET /inventory/transactions` (`inventory.view`, literal path, paginated `limit`/`offset` newest-first, filters `item_id`/`stock_id`/`transaction_type`, each row enriched with item name/sku + warehouse name via `JOIN`). Frontend: `InvoiceDetail.tsx` gained its first-ever "Add Item" form (it previously had none at all — items could only be added via `POST /invoices/generate`); both `InvoiceDetail.tsx` and `QuoteDetail.tsx`'s add-item forms gained an optional product-catalog dropdown that autofills description/price and shows `on hand: N` (red when ≤ 0) for inventory-linked products — free-text lines keep working unchanged. `InventoryManagement.tsx` gained a "Movements" tab reading `GET /inventory/transactions` (item + type filters). Fixed a pre-existing bug found while touching this code: `InventoryList.tsx`'s per-warehouse stock modal rendered a negative quantity in green (`row.quantity === 0 ? red : green` never matched negative numbers) — now red for any quantity ≤ 0.
>
> **Migration 390 (continued) — Idempotent conversion + integer-quantity/void hardening (adversarial review):** Adds nullable `quotes.converted_invoice_id BIGINT UNSIGNED` (`ON DELETE SET NULL`, FK to `invoices`) so `POST /quotes/:id/convert-to-invoice` is idempotent: the earlier version gated only on `status === 'accepted'` while its own terminal write left status at `'accepted'`, so a retry/double-click sailed straight through and created a **duplicate invoice plus a duplicate stock drawdown**. The route now sets `converted_invoice_id` inside the *same* transaction as the invoice `INSERT`, and a second attempt is rejected with `409 CONVERSION_EXISTS` (message includes the existing invoice number/id) before any transaction opens. `QuoteDetail.tsx` hides the Convert button and shows a "Converted to invoice: <link>" once `converted_invoice_id` is set. Also fixes: (1) **fractional quantity on an inventory-linked line** silently rounded on drawdown (`invoice_items`/`quote_items.quantity` is `DECIMAL(10,2)`, stock/ledger are integer columns) — `POST /invoices/:id/items` and `POST /quotes/:id/items` now `422` with a clear message when `inventory_item_id` is set and `quantity` is not a whole number (free-text lines are unaffected); `inventoryDrawdownService.drawdownForSale` also `Math.round()`s defensively as a second line of defense. Frontend: the product-picker quantity input switches to `step=1 min=1` once an inventory-linked product is selected, with a local translated validation error before submit. (2) **`POST /invoices/:id/items` never checked invoice status**, so an inventory-linked line added to a **void** invoice still decremented stock — the route now looks up `status` in its org-scoped invoice lookup (both the plain and inventory-linked branches, closing a second pre-existing gap where the plain branch didn't even org-verify the invoice at all) and rejects with `422 INVOICE_VOID`, mirroring the existing `beforeUpdate` guard on `PUT`/`PATCH`. (3) **Documented, not changed:** dropping the negative-stock trigger (above) also lets pre-existing manual outbound transactions (`assign_to_job`/`transfer_out` via `POST /inventory/transactions`) go negative where they previously got a loud `SIGNAL` error — this is the accepted org-wide policy (negative stock allowed, rendered red), not a regression.
>
> **Migration 389 — Atomic per-organization quote-number sequence:** Adds `organization_quote_sequences` (`organization_id` PRIMARY KEY, sentinel `0` = the NULL/single-tenant bucket; `next_number`), mirroring migration 381's pattern exactly (same `INSERT IGNORE` + `UPDATE ... SET next_number = LAST_INSERT_ID(next_number) + 1` idiom, deliberately not a single `ON DUPLICATE KEY UPDATE` — see migration 381's note for why). Unlike invoices, quotes had **no** auto-numbering at all before this: `quotes.quote_number` is `NOT NULL` with no default, so every caller had to supply one itself. Adds the new exported `billingService.nextQuoteNumber(conn, orgId)` helper (`QUO-` + zero-padded-6) and wires it into `POST /quotes` and the new `POST /quotes/generate` (see below) so `quote_number` is optional again — omit it and one is auto-assigned; an explicit value is still honored (still subject to the existing `uq_quotes_org_number` unique key). Seeded from existing data (including soft-deleted rows) so already-issued numbers are never reissued.
>
> **Migration 389 (continued) — `POST /quotes/generate`, mirroring `POST /invoices/generate`'s flexible item path:** Accepts `{client_id, items: [{type: 'contract'|'product'|'custom', contract_id?, description?, quantity, unit_price}]}`, org-verifies the client, and resolves each item the way `POST /invoices/generate` does with one deliberate exception: `contract` items look up the contract + its plan and price it at `contract.price_override || plan.price` **without** calling `billingService.generateBillingPeriod()` — that helper has side effects (creates or reuses a real `billing_periods` row, later marked `'invoiced'` by actual invoice generation), which is correct for a real invoice but wrong for a quote that is only an estimate and may never be accepted; `product`/`custom` items take the client-supplied `description`/`quantity`/`unit_price` as-is (there is no separate product/add-on catalog lookup on the quotes side — `POST /invoices/generate`'s "product" type resolves the same way, trusting whatever the frontend already picked from `plans.addons` client-side). Computes `subtotal`/`tax_amount`/`total` using the **same fraction math** (`tax_rate` from the org's default `tax_rates` row, `subtotal * taxRate`, never `* 100` — the historical 100×-tax bug class), inserts the quote (`status = 'draft'`) with an auto-assigned `quote_number` (`nextQuoteNumber`, same transaction) and its `quote_items`, and returns the created quote. `requirePermission('quotes.create')`. This is the actual "create a quote like an invoice" flow — the per-item `POST /quotes/:id/items` endpoint (added by an earlier PR on this branch) still exists for adding items to an already-created quote from `QuoteDetail`, but quote *creation* now mirrors `GenerateInvoiceModal`'s all-at-once builder via a new `GenerateQuoteModal`.
>
> **Migration 388 — Configurable diagnostic thresholds (fiber optical, wireless signal, wireless link-capacity):** Adds `optical_min_dbm` (SMALLINT), `wireless_signal_min_dbm` (SMALLINT), and `wireless_link_capacity_min_mbps` (DECIMAL(8,2)) to `contracts` (after `escalate_on_disconnect`, migration 387's sibling columns); adds `signal_min_dbm` (SMALLINT) and `link_capacity_min_mbps` (DECIMAL(8,2)) to `ap_sector_configs` (after `max_clients`). All 5 are nullable with no non-NULL default, so this migration changes zero runtime behavior until explicitly configured. `diagnosticEngineService.js` resolves each threshold with a three-tier `??` chain, most-specific wins: fiber optical min = `contract.optical_min_dbm ?? -27` (code constant, unchanged); wireless signal min = `contract.wireless_signal_min_dbm ?? sector.signal_min_dbm ?? -75` (code constant, unchanged) — the serving sector is resolved via `wireless_client_sessions.device_id` on the same latest-session row `_getWirelessSignal` already fetches for `cpe_signal`, joined to `ap_sector_configs` (soft-delete-guarded: `deleted_at IS NULL`, matching the #404 contract-lookup fix); wireless link-capacity min (Mbps) = `contract.wireless_link_capacity_min_mbps ?? sector.link_capacity_min_mbps ?? null` — **no org-wide default exists**, so an unconfigured client's capacity check is never fabricated. New check `cpe_link_capacity` compares the same session row's `tx_rate_mbps`/`rx_rate_mbps` (the negotiated RF link rate, e.g. Ubiquiti "link capacity" — NOT a client-count/AP-load percentage; the older `ap_load` check is a distinct, still-unimplemented stub, untouched) against the resolved minimum: status `unknown` when no threshold is configured for this client/sector or no recent link-rate telemetry exists, `warning` when either direction is below the minimum, else `ok`. `cpe_link_capacity` is added to `QUALITY_ESCALATE` at `['warning']` alongside `cpe_signal` — a low negotiated link rate is a per-client RF-quality problem, gated by the same per-contract `escalation_enabled`/`escalate_on_disconnect` toggles from migration 387. New columns added to `Contract.fillable`, `src/middleware/schemas/contracts.js` (create/update), and `src/middleware/schemas/wirelessSectors.js` (create/update AP sector config) — gated by the existing `contracts.update`/`ap_sectors.update` permissions, no new permission slug. Frontend: a new "RF Thresholds" tab on `DeviceDetail.tsx` (shown only for `ptmp_ap`/`ptp` devices) creates/edits the serving sector's two threshold fields via the existing `/wireless/ap-sectors` CRUD; three optional override inputs added to `ContractList.tsx`'s Edit Contract modal, next to the migration-387 escalation toggles — blank explicitly submits `null` (not omitted) so a previously-set override can be cleared back to "use default". Also adds a `/wireless` nav entry (`WirelessManagementPage.tsx` was routed but had no menu link — a pre-existing dead end) and fixes `WirelessManagementPage.tsx`'s AP-sector/channel-plan/interference "save" actions, which sent `PATCH` against routes only registered as `PUT` in `src/routes/wirelessManagement.js` (a pre-existing, independently-discovered bug — every edit on that page 404'd). Known limitations, not fixed by this migration: the Settings → Org Config tab (`GET /settings`) has an unrelated pre-existing response-shape bug and was left untouched, since the global thresholds here are code constants, not settings-table rows; a CPE that has never reported a `wireless_client_sessions` row has no resolvable serving sector (same pre-existing limitation the `cpe_signal` check already has — sector thresholds cannot fix what has no telemetry to key off of).
>
> **Migration 387 — Per-contract AI-diagnostic auto-escalation toggles:** Adds `escalation_enabled` (TINYINT(1), default 1) and `escalate_on_disconnect` (TINYINT(1), default 0) to `contracts`. `diagnosticEngineService.js`'s auto-escalation rule (fix/escalate-quality-only, same PR) fires org-wide only on measured signal-quality faults (`onu_signal` error / `cpe_signal` warning|error) by default — most service areas have frequent grid power outages and no customer UPS, so offline/disconnect is normal, not a fault. These two contract-level flags make that overridable per client: `escalation_enabled = 0` is a master switch that disables ALL auto-escalation for that contract regardless of fault; `escalate_on_disconnect = 1` (for clients who do have a UPS, where offline genuinely is abnormal) additionally escalates on `onu_status`/`cpe_status` offline and dropped `pppoe_session`/`radius_session` checks, on top of the always-on quality rule — `account_suspension` is deliberately never included (a billing hold is not a disconnect fault). `runDiagnostic` resolves the client's active contract's two flags and threads them through `_buildResult`/`_escalatingChecks`; no contract resolved falls back to the same defaults (enabled, quality-only). Both fields are on the existing `Contract.fillable`/`contracts` validation schemas, gated by the existing `contracts.update` permission — no new permission slug. No OpenAPI path change (contracts uses the generic untyped `crudPaths()` body), but `components.schemas` regenerated since `src/middleware/schemas/contracts.js` changed. Frontend: two checkboxes added to the Edit Contract modal (`ContractList.tsx`), i18n'd in en/es/pt-BR.

> **Migration 386 — Per-organization outbound email (SMTP) configuration:** Adds `organization_email_settings` (one row per org) with a write-only three-state password contract (omitted → keep; `""` → clear; value → encrypt and replace), real connection testing, and admin/super-admin-only permissions. Migration 460 subsequently hardens this surface: every password write/read uses authenticated AES-256-GCM strictly, public DTOs expose only non-secret metadata such as `configured`/`has_password`, connection identity changes require an explicit replacement or clear, test errors are sanitized and rate-limited, and tenant SMTP connects only to DNS-pinned public addresses over implicit TLS or mandatory STARTTLS. Settings are read authoritatively for every send rather than held in a cross-replica cache. Client delivery records organization/client epochs and message class, then repeats DND/consent checks immediately before provider I/O. The global install relay remains a separate explicitly operational lane for staff/system recipients.
>
> **Migration 385 — Portal (subscriber self-service) password reset:** Adds `portal_reset_token_hash` and `portal_reset_token_expires` to `clients` (plus a non-unique lookup index on the hash column), mirroring migration 382's fix but for the client portal's separate auth stack (`clients.portal_password_hash`, not `users`) — previously a subscriber who forgot their portal password had no self-service recovery path at all; only a staff member manually resetting it via `portalAuthService.setPassword` worked. Adds `POST /portal/auth/password-reset/request` and `POST /portal/auth/password-reset` (both public, in `src/routes/portal.js`), a new `portalAuthService.requestPasswordReset`/`resetPassword`, and a dedicated `portalPasswordResetLimiter` (separate express-rate-limit instance/budget from the staff-side `passwordResetLimiter`, applied route-level per `portal.js`'s convention rather than `app.js`'s path-prefix convention). Anti-enumeration: the request endpoint returns an identical generic message whether the email is unknown, the account exists but has portal access never enabled (`portal_password_hash IS NULL`), or the account is `inactive` — none of those three cases mints a token or sends email, so forgot-password can never become a silent self-activation path for a portal account the ISP has not turned on. Reuses the existing `passwordResetEmail` template (reset URL: `${config.appUrl}/portal/reset-password?token=...`). On successful reset: clears `portal_login_attempts`/`portal_locked_until` (lockout-clear) and revokes all outstanding `portal_refresh_tokens` for the client (the portal's equivalent of the staff flow's session wipe). No new permission slug: portal routes are gated by client identity (`portalAuthenticate`), not RBAC.
>
> **Migration 384 — Atomic per-organization service-order-number sequence:** Adds `organization_order_sequences` (`organization_id` PRIMARY KEY, sentinel `0` = the NULL/single-tenant bucket; `next_number`), mirroring migration 381's pattern. Replaces the `SELECT COUNT(*) FROM service_orders WHERE organization_id <=> ?` → `SO-${cnt+1}` pattern in `lifecycleService.generateOrderNumber` (the same non-locking-read race migration 381 fixed for invoices — two concurrent `POST /service-orders` for the same org could both read the same count and both `INSERT` the same `order_number`, hitting the `uq_service_orders_org_number` unique-key 500) with the new exported `lifecycleService.nextOrderNumber(conn, orgId)` helper, an atomic `INSERT IGNORE` + `UPDATE ... SET next_number = LAST_INSERT_ID(next_number) + 1`. Seeded from existing data (including soft-deleted rows) so already-issued numbers are never reissued. `SO-` + zero-padded-6 formatting is unchanged. This closes the gap migration 381 explicitly left out of scope (see below).
>
> **Migration 382 — Password reset + email verification columns:** Adds `reset_token_hash`, `reset_token_expires`, `email_verify_token_hash`, and `email_verified_at` to `users` (plus non-unique lookup indexes on the two hash columns), closing a gap where `POST /auth/password-reset/request`, `POST /auth/password-reset`, and `POST /auth/verify-email` 500'd on every real call — the columns they read/wrote never existed. Also wires the previously-orphaned `passwordResetEmail`/`emailVerificationEmail` templates to actually send (`src/routes/auth.js`'s `/password-reset/request` handler; `authService.register()`), triggers a verification token on every new registration, and adds `POST /auth/verify-email/resend` (authenticated, no-op if already verified). `email_verified_at` is informational only — nothing gates login on it, so existing rows are left `NULL` (no backfill). No new permission slug: `/verify-email/resend` follows the same self-service `authenticate`-only pattern as `/change-password`.
>
> **Migration 381 — Atomic per-organization invoice-number sequence:** Adds `organization_invoice_sequences` (`organization_id` PRIMARY KEY, sentinel `0` = the NULL/single-tenant bucket; `next_number`). Replaces the `SELECT COUNT(*) FROM invoices WHERE organization_id = ?` → `INV-${cnt+1}` pattern (a non-locking read that two concurrent invoice-generation calls for the same org could both read identically, then both `INSERT` the same `invoice_number` and hit the `uq_invoices_org_number` unique-key 500) at all four generation sites — `billingService.generateInvoice`, `billingService.createOneOffInvoice`, `POST /invoices/generate`, and `POST /quotes/:id/convert-to-invoice` — with the new exported `billingService.nextInvoiceNumber(conn, orgId)` helper, an atomic `INSERT ... ON DUPLICATE KEY UPDATE next_number = LAST_INSERT_ID(next_number) + 1`. Seeded from existing data so already-issued numbers are never reissued. `INV-` + zero-padded-6 formatting is unchanged; numbers beyond 999999 just grow longer. (Service-order `SO-######` numbering was a separate, still-`COUNT(*)`-based helper — closed by migration 384, see above.)
>
> **Migration 380 — Simplified service-order flow:** Replaces the 5-state `service_orders.status` (`requested`→`approved`→`provisioning`→`activated`, or `cancelled`) with a 4-state flow: `new`→`in_process`→`done`, plus `cancelled` (reachable from `new` or `in_process`). Adds `started_at`/`completed_at` DATETIME columns; existing rows are remapped (`requested`/`approved`→`new`, `provisioning`→`in_process` with `started_at` backfilled, `activated`→`done` with `started_at`/`completed_at` backfilled) and `approved_at`/`approved_by`/`activated_at` are kept for history but no longer written. Also widens `clients.address` to `VARCHAR(500)` to match `leads.address`. Routes: `POST /service-orders/:id/{approve,provision,activate}` are removed and replaced by `POST /service-orders/:id/start` (transitions `new`→`in_process`; for `order_type = 'new_install'` this auto-creates and provisions a `pending` contract from the order's client/lead + plan — converting an unconverted lead on the fly — mirroring `POST /contracts`) and `POST /service-orders/:id/complete` (transitions `in_process`→`done`; body `{ billing: 'already_paid' | 'create_invoice', installation_fee?, description? }` — `create_invoice` raises a one-off issued invoice for the installation fee via `billingService.createOneOffInvoice` and activates the linked `pending` contract). `POST /service-orders/:id/cancel` is unchanged.

> **Migrations 190–192 — Subscriber profile management (§1.1):** `190_add_profile_fields_to_clients.sql` adds `latitude`, `longitude`, `geocoded_at`, `credit_score`, and `risk_rating` to `clients` and extends `client_type` with `corporate`. `191_create_client_custom_fields_table.sql` adds unlimited per-client key/value custom fields. `192_create_client_groups_table.sql` adds the `client_groups` table (family/account grouping) plus `clients.client_group_id`. New endpoints: `POST /clients/:id/geocode`, `GET/PUT/DELETE /clients/:id/custom-fields`, `GET/POST/DELETE /clients/:id/documents`, `GET /clients/:id/duplicates`, `GET /clients/duplicates/scan`, `POST /clients/:id/merge`, plus full CRUD under `/client-groups`. Geocoding requires `GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY`.

> **Migration 051 — Multi-currency ALTER:** `051_add_currency_to_financial_tables.sql` adds a `currency CHAR(3) NOT NULL DEFAULT 'USD'` column (ISO 4217 currency code) to `invoices`, `payments`, `credit_notes`, `quotes`, `plans`, and `expenses`. This is an ALTER TABLE migration applied after the initial schema creation.

> **Migration 053 — Preflight check procedure:** `053_create_preflight_check_event_scheduler.sql` creates the `preflight_check_event_scheduler()` stored procedure. It does not create a table. Call `CALL preflight_check_event_scheduler();` during deployment to verify the MySQL Event Scheduler is enabled before the application starts.

> **Migration 056 — Tax rate references ALTER:** `056_add_tax_rate_id_to_financial_tables.sql` adds a `tax_rate_id BIGINT UNSIGNED NULL` foreign key column to `invoices`, `quotes`, and `credit_notes`, linking them to the `tax_rates` master table. The existing `tax_rate` DECIMAL column is kept as a snapshot of the rate at document-creation time.

> **Migration 058 — Template FK on email_logs ALTER:** `058_add_template_id_to_email_logs.sql` adds a `template_id BIGINT UNSIGNED NULL` foreign key column to `email_logs`, linking each sent message to the `message_templates` table. The existing `template` VARCHAR column is kept for backward compatibility and free-text template names.

> **Migration 065 — Locale switch ALTER:** `065_add_locale_to_clients_and_organizations.sql` adds `locale ENUM('global','MX') NOT NULL DEFAULT 'global'` to both `clients` and `organizations`. Setting `locale = 'MX'` activates MX-specific product workflows at the app layer; it does not determine that a legal obligation applies or has been satisfied. Existing clients with a CURP are back-filled to `'MX'`.

> **Migration 069 — SAT catalog seed:** `069_seed_sat_catalogs.sql` populates the six SAT CFDI 4.0 catalog tables (sat_regimen_fiscal, sat_uso_cfdi, sat_forma_pago, sat_metodo_pago, sat_tipo_comprobante, sat_moneda) with official SAT values. Uses `INSERT IGNORE` for idempotent re-runs.

> **Migration 074 — Mexico payment methods ALTER:** `074_add_mexico_payment_methods.sql` extends `payments.payment_method` with `oxxo_pay`, `spei`, `codi`, `convenience_store`, and `digital_wallet`, and adds `sat_forma_pago VARCHAR(2)`, `clabe VARCHAR(18)`, and `bank_name VARCHAR(100)` columns.

> **Migration 078 — MX contract template FK ALTER:** `078_add_mx_template_to_contracts.sql` adds `contract_template_mx_id BIGINT UNSIGNED NULL` to `contracts`, linking each contract to an IFT/CRT-registered Carta de Adhesión template. NULL for global clients.

> **Migration 082 — SAT product/unit catalog seed:** `082_seed_sat_clave_prod_serv_and_unidad.sql` populates the ISP-relevant subset of the SAT `c_ClaveProdServ` (7 codes including `81161700` Internet, `81161500` VoIP, `01010101` No aplica) and `c_ClaveUnidad` (6 codes including `E48` Service unit, `MON` Month, `H87` Piece) catalog tables. Uses `INSERT IGNORE` for idempotent re-runs.

> **Migration 084 — CFDI XML/PDF storage ALTER:** `084_add_xml_pdf_storage_to_cfdi_documents.sql` adds `signed_xml LONGTEXT NULL` (complete timbrado XML from PAC — SAT requires 5-year retention), `xml_file_id BIGINT UNSIGNED NULL` (FK to `files` for archival/object-storage), and `pdf_file_id BIGINT UNSIGNED NULL` (FK to `files` for generated PDF) to `cfdi_documents`.

> **Migration 086 — MX locale backfill for company clients:** `086_backfill_mx_locale_for_company_clients.sql` fixes an incomplete backfill from migration 065 — sets `locale = 'MX'` for clients that have a `client_mx_profiles` row but were left on `locale = 'global'` (company clients without a CURP). Also back-fills organizations with an `organization_mx_profiles` row.

> **Migration 087 — MX locale enforcement triggers:** `087_create_mx_locale_enforcement_triggers.sql` adds BEFORE INSERT / BEFORE UPDATE triggers on all MX-specific tables (`client_mx_profiles`, `organization_mx_profiles`, `cfdi_documents`, `concession_titles`, `contract_templates_mx`, `regulatory_filings`, `ift_statistical_reports`) to enforce that the referenced client or organization has `locale = 'MX'`. Also guards `contracts.contract_template_mx_id` — a non-NULL value requires the contract's client to have `locale = 'MX'`. Raises SQLSTATE '45000' on violation.

> **Migration 088 — Locale downgrade guard triggers:** `088_create_locale_downgrade_guard_triggers.sql` adds BEFORE UPDATE triggers on `clients` and `organizations` to prevent changing `locale` from `'MX'` to `'global'` when MX-dependent records exist (MX profiles, CFDI documents, concession titles, contract templates, regulatory filings, IFT statistical reports). Raises SQLSTATE '45000' on violation.

> **Migration 091 — Factura pública stamping safeguards:** `091_add_factura_publica_stamping_safeguards.sql` adds a stored function and two triggers that enforce business rules at stamp time:
> - **`fn_predominant_forma_pago(p_factura_publica_invoice_id)`** — stored function that calculates the predominant SAT `FormaPago` code for a factura pública by summing `payments.amount` grouped by `sat_forma_pago` across all linked invoices and returning the code with the highest total. Defaults to `'99'` (Por definir) when no payments exist or when two or more codes tie for the highest total. Call this function at stamp time to populate `cfdi_documents.forma_pago`. Business rule (SAT Anexo 20 CFDI 4.0): *"En caso de que el pago se realice utilizando más de una forma de pago, se debe indicar la que represente el monto mayor."*
> - **`trg_factura_publica_invoices_bu`** — BEFORE UPDATE trigger on `factura_publica_invoices` that prevents `status` from being set to `'stamped'` if any invoice linked via `factura_publica_invoice_items` does not have `status = 'paid'`. Raises SQLSTATE '45000'. Business rule: including unpaid invoices in a stamped CFDI forces the ISP to pay taxes on revenue it has not yet collected; if the client cancels or never pays, those taxes cannot be recovered.
> - **`trg_factura_publica_invoice_items_bi`** — BEFORE INSERT trigger on `factura_publica_invoice_items` that rejects linking an invoice whose `status` is not `'paid'`. Raises SQLSTATE '45000'. Enforces the same unpaid-invoice exclusion incrementally at insert time.

> **Migration 092 — Exportacion field ALTER:** `092_add_exportacion_to_cfdi_documents.sql` adds `exportacion ENUM('01','02','03') NOT NULL DEFAULT '01'` to `cfdi_documents`. This is a mandatory SAT CFDI 4.0 attribute on the `<Comprobante>` node: `01` = no export (domestic, most common for ISPs), `02` = definitive export, `03` = temporary export. Omitting it causes PAC rejection.

> **Migration 093 — Complemento de Pago 2.0 tax support:** `093_add_complemento_pago_2_tax_support.sql` adds `objeto_imp_dr ENUM('01','02','03') NOT NULL DEFAULT '02'` to `cfdi_payment_complement_items` (ObjetoImpDR on each DoctoRelacionado) and creates the `cfdi_payment_complement_item_taxes` table for per-document-related tax breakdown (`ImpuestosP`). Required by SAT Complemento de Pago 2.0 when `objeto_imp_dr = '02'`.

> **Migration 094 — CFDI document FK constraints:** `094_add_fks_cfdi_documents_to_sat_catalogs.sql` adds foreign key constraints from `cfdi_documents` to SAT catalog tables: `tipo_comprobante` → `sat_tipo_comprobante`, `uso_cfdi` → `sat_uso_cfdi`, `metodo_pago` → `sat_metodo_pago`, `forma_pago` → `sat_forma_pago`, `moneda` → `sat_moneda`. Prevents invalid SAT codes from being stored.

> **Migration 095 — CFDI conceptos FK constraints:** `095_add_fks_cfdi_conceptos_to_sat_catalogs.sql` adds foreign key constraints from `cfdi_conceptos` to SAT catalog tables: `clave_prod_serv` → `sat_clave_prod_serv`, `clave_unidad` → `sat_clave_unidad`. Prevents invalid SAT product/service and unit codes on CFDI line items.

> **Migration 096 — SAT catalog seed expansion:** `096_seed_missing_sat_catalog_entries.sql` adds missing `sat_regimen_fiscal` codes (`607` Enajenación o Adquisición de Bienes, `609` Consolidación, `611` Ingresos por Dividendos, `615` Ingresos por obtención de premios) and `sat_uso_cfdi` codes (`D05`–`D10`: medical insurance premiums, school transportation, savings plan deposits, tuition, voluntary SAR contributions, major medical insurance premiums). Uses `INSERT IGNORE` for idempotent re-runs.

> **Migration 097 — Facturar guard triggers:** `097_add_facturar_guard_triggers.sql` adds BEFORE INSERT / BEFORE UPDATE triggers on `contracts` that raise SQLSTATE '45000' when `facturar = TRUE` and the client's `locale != 'MX'`. Prevents non-MX clients from being assigned to the Mexican e-invoicing workflow.

> **Migration 098 — Country default NULL:** `098_set_country_default_null.sql` changes the DEFAULT for `clients.country` and `organizations.country` from `'US'` to `NULL`. Existing rows are not modified — only future inserts without an explicit country value will receive `NULL` instead of `'US'`.

> **Migration 099 — Fix XXX currency description:** `099_fix_xxx_currency_description.sql` updates `sat_moneda` to set the `XXX` currency description to the official SAT text: *"Los códigos asignados para las transacciones en que no intervenga ninguna moneda"* (previously incorrectly set to *"Los derechos en esta divisa"*).

> **Migration 100 — CSD expiry monitoring task:** `100_seed_csd_expiry_scheduled_task.sql` inserts a system-level scheduled task (`csd_expiry_monitor`, cron `0 8 * * *`) that checks `organization_mx_profiles.csd_valid_to` for certificates expiring within 30 days and generates email + in-app notifications. Uses `INSERT IGNORE` for idempotent re-runs. If a CSD expires, the ISP cannot stamp any new CFDIs.

> **Migration 101 — Payment gateways:** `101_create_payment_gateways_table.sql` creates the `payment_gateways` table for per-organization payment provider configuration (Stripe, Conekta, OpenPay, MercadoPago, PayPal, manual, other). Stores environment (sandbox/production), encrypted secret key, optional public key, webhook signing secret, default flag, and a JSON column for provider-specific settings.

> **Migration 102 — Payment transactions:** `102_create_payment_transactions_table.sql` creates the `payment_transactions` table — a raw gateway transaction log for every payment attempt. Records the provider's reference ID, gateway status (pending/succeeded/failed/refunded/disputed/cancelled), raw request/response JSON, webhook payload, and a unique idempotency key to prevent duplicate charges.

> **Migration 103 — Recurring payment profiles:** `103_create_recurring_payment_profiles_table.sql` creates the `recurring_payment_profiles` table for stored card tokens per client (autopay). Holds the gateway's customer or card token, card brand, last four digits, expiry month/year, default flag, and lifecycle status (active/expired/revoked).

> **Migration 104 — Suspension rules:** `104_create_suspension_rules_table.sql` creates the `suspension_rules` table for configurable auto-suspend/disconnect rules per organization. Each rule specifies a days-past-due threshold, grace period, action (auto_suspend/notify_only/auto_disconnect), optional advance notification window, and optional plan-ID scoping via JSON.

> **Migration 105 — Suspension logs:** `105_create_suspension_logs_table.sql` creates the `suspension_logs` table — a full audit trail of suspend/unsuspend/disconnect/reconnect events per contract. Records the triggering rule (NULL for manual actions), performer, RADIUS CoA sent/response, linked invoice, and suspend/restore timestamps.

> **Migration 106 — CSD certificates:** `106_create_csd_certificates_table.sql` creates the `csd_certificates` table for storing CSD `.cer`/`.key` files per organization. Holds PEM-encoded public certificate, application-encrypted private key, optional encrypted passphrase, SHA-256 fingerprint (unique), certificate number (NoCertificado, unique), RFC, validity window, and active/expired/revoked status. The `valid_to` column is used by the CSD expiry monitor task (migration 100).

> **Migration 107 — PAC providers:** `107_create_pac_providers_table.sql` creates the `pac_providers` table for PAC (Proveedor Autorizado de Certificación) credentials and endpoint configuration. Supports Finkok, SW Sapien, Digicel, Comercio Digital, FacturAPI with sandbox/production environments. Unique constraint on `(organization_id, provider_name, environment)`.

> **Migration 108 — Webhooks:** `108_create_webhooks_table.sql` creates the `webhooks` table for outbound webhook registrations per organization. Each record defines a target URL, encrypted HMAC signing secret, JSON array of subscribed event names, max retries (default 5), and timeout (default 30s).

> **Migration 109 — Webhook deliveries:** `109_create_webhook_deliveries_table.sql` creates the `webhook_deliveries` table — a per-attempt delivery log for outbound webhooks. Records HTTP status code, response body, response time, attempt number, delivery status (pending/success/failed/retrying), and next retry timestamp.

> **Migration 110 — Organization users:** `110_create_organization_users_table.sql` creates the `organization_users` pivot table linking users to organizations with per-organization roles (owner/admin/manager/technician/billing/readonly). Unique on `(organization_id, user_id)`. Enables multi-tenant user membership where one user account can belong to multiple organizations.

> **Migration 111 — Plan add-ons:** `111_create_plan_addons_table.sql` creates the `plan_addons` catalog table for upsellable add-ons per organization — static IP, extra IP block, extra bandwidth, equipment rental, or other. Stores price, billing cycle (monthly/one-time/yearly), taxability flag, and availability status.

> **Migration 112 — Contract add-ons:** `112_create_contract_addons_table.sql` creates the `contract_addons` table for add-ons attached to a specific client contract. References the plan_addons catalog and stores contracted quantity, negotiated unit price, start/end dates, and lifecycle status (active/cancelled/expired).

> **Migration 113 — Speed tests:** `113_create_speed_tests_table.sql` creates the `speed_tests` table for recording speed test results from multiple sources (client_portal/technician/automated_probe/external). Stores download/upload Mbps, latency, jitter, packet loss, observed IP address, and tested-at timestamp. Optional FKs to clients, contracts, and devices.

> **Migration 114 — Ticket SLA events:** `114_create_ticket_sla_events_table.sql` creates the `ticket_sla_events` table for SLA tracking per support ticket. Records milestones (first_response/resolution/escalation/breach_warning/breach), target deadline, actual timestamp, breach flag, and minutes past deadline. FK to `sla_definitions` (migration 063).

> **Migration 115 — SMS logs:** `115_create_sms_logs_table.sql` creates the `sms_logs` table for SMS and WhatsApp notification logging per organization. Complements `email_logs` for non-email channels. Captures direction (outbound/inbound), provider name, provider message ID, delivery status, error details, per-message cost, and send/delivery timestamps. FK to `message_templates`.

> **Migration 116 — Revenue summary:** `116_create_revenue_summary_table.sql` creates the `revenue_summary` materialized table for MRR/churn/ARPU reporting — populated by a scheduled task, not a SQL VIEW. One row per organization per calendar month per currency. Stores MRR, active clients/contracts, new/churned contracts, ARPU, total revenue/collected/outstanding.

> **Migration 117 — Network health snapshots:** `117_create_network_health_snapshots_table.sql` creates the `network_health_snapshots` table for aggregated daily device and link health data. Stores uptime %, avg/max latency, avg/peak throughput in/out, packet loss, and total downtime minutes. Composite indexes on `(device_id, snapshot_date)` and `(network_link_id, snapshot_date)`.

> **Migration 118 — CFDI cancellations:** `118_create_cfdi_cancellations_table.sql` creates the `cfdi_cancellations` table — a SAT CFDI cancellation audit trail. Records the cancellation reason code (motivo: 01=con relación, 02=sin relación, 03=no se llevó a cabo, 04=nominativa en CFDI global), optional replacement UUID (folio_sustitucion, required for motivo 01), PAC response status, raw acuse XML, and requesting user. FK to `cfdi_documents`, `pac_providers`, and `users`.

> **Migration 119 — Seed default roles and permissions:** `119_seed_default_roles_and_permissions.sql` inserts the five built-in system roles (`admin`, `billing`, `support`, `technician`, `readonly`) with `is_system = TRUE` so they cannot be deleted. Also inserts all granular permission slugs (e.g. `clients.view`, `invoices.create`, `devices.delete`, `audit_logs.view`) grouped by module, and the `role_permissions` mappings: `admin` gets all permissions; `billing` gets billing/financial access; `support` gets client/ticket access; `technician` gets device/job/inventory access; `readonly` gets all `*.view` and `*.export` permissions. Uses `INSERT IGNORE` for idempotent re-runs.

> **Migration 120 — Seed default settings:** `120_seed_default_settings.sql` populates the `settings` key-value table with 25 default values covering currency (`default_currency = USD`), invoice/quote/credit-note prefixes, SMTP configuration, SNMP polling interval and community, company profile fields, locale/date-format/pagination preferences, session and login security parameters, and automation flags (`auto_suspend_enabled`, `auto_invoice_enabled`). Uses `INSERT IGNORE` — administrator-customised values are never overwritten on re-runs.

> **Migration 121 — Seed default tax rates:** `121_seed_default_tax_rates.sql` inserts four globally applicable default tax rates (`organization_id = NULL`): Tax Exempt (0%), Standard Tax 8%, IVA 16% (Mexico), and GST 5% (Canada). Uses `WHERE NOT EXISTS` guards for full idempotency since the `tax_rates` table does not carry a `UNIQUE` constraint on `name` alone.

> **Migration 122 — Seed default suspension rule:** `122_seed_default_suspension_rule.sql` inserts a default auto-suspend rule into `suspension_rules` for the first organization (id = 1): 30 days past due, 5-day grace period, action `auto_suspend`. Uses `WHERE NOT EXISTS` to be idempotent. Because `suspension_rules.organization_id` is `NOT NULL`, this seed targets org id = 1; administrators should add per-organization rules as part of tenant onboarding.

> **Migration 123 — Seed scheduled tasks for core automation:** `123_seed_scheduled_tasks_core_automation.sql` inserts the five system-level automation tasks that drive VigaBSS's main operational loops: `auto_generate_invoices` (daily at 01:00), `auto_suspend_overdue` (daily at 06:00), `radius_sync` (every 5 min), `populate_revenue_summary` (monthly on the 1st at 02:00), and `populate_network_health_snapshots` (daily at 04:00). All tasks use `organization_id = NULL` (global) and `is_enabled = TRUE`. Uses `INSERT IGNORE` on the `UNIQUE KEY (organization_id, task_name)`.

> **Migration 124 — Add currency to expenses (idempotent guard):** `124_add_currency_to_expenses.sql` adds `expenses.currency CHAR(3) NOT NULL DEFAULT 'USD'` after the `amount` column for multi-currency expense tracking. The migration is wrapped in a stored-procedure guard that checks `INFORMATION_SCHEMA.COLUMNS` before issuing the `ALTER TABLE`, making it a safe no-op on installations where migration 051 already applied the same column.

> **Migration 125 — Add tax_rate_id to line-item tables:** `125_add_tax_rate_id_to_line_item_tables.sql` adds a `tax_rate_id BIGINT UNSIGNED NULL` foreign-key column to `invoice_items`, `quote_items`, and `credit_note_items`. `NULL` means "inherit the rate from the parent document". This enables per-line-item tax rates for mixed-rate invoices common in multi-tax-rate jurisdictions (e.g. different rates for hardware vs. services). `ON DELETE SET NULL` prevents cascading deletes when a `tax_rates` row is removed.

> **Migration 126 — Payment allocation balance guard triggers:** `126_payment_allocation_balance_guard_triggers.sql` adds four `BEFORE INSERT / BEFORE UPDATE` triggers on `payment_allocations` that enforce two financial integrity rules at the database level: (1) the total allocated amount for a payment cannot exceed `payments.amount`, and (2) the total allocated amount for an invoice cannot exceed `invoices.total`. Both violations raise `SQLSTATE '45000'` with descriptive messages. Uses `DROP TRIGGER IF EXISTS` before each `CREATE TRIGGER` for safe re-runs.

> **Migration 127 — Inventory stock negative guard trigger:** `127_inventory_stock_negative_guard_trigger.sql` adds a `BEFORE UPDATE` trigger on `inventory_stock` that raises `SQLSTATE '45000'` when a stock update would set `quantity < 0`. This prevents physically impossible inventory state from silently corrupting reports and downstream job fulfillment. Uses `DROP TRIGGER IF EXISTS` for safe re-runs.

> **Migration 128 — PPPoE contract RADIUS consistency trigger:** `128_connection_type_radius_consistency_trigger.sql` adds a `BEFORE UPDATE` trigger on `contracts` that raises `SQLSTATE '45000'` when a contract with `connection_type IN ('pppoe', 'pppoe_dual')` is activated (`status` changed to `'active'`) without at least one corresponding `radius` row. Contracts start in `pending` status so RADIUS accounts can be provisioned before activation; the guard fires only at activation time. Uses `DROP TRIGGER IF EXISTS` for safe re-runs.

> **Migration 129 — Composite indexes for query performance:** `129_add_composite_indexes_for_query_performance.sql` adds five composite indexes for common multi-column query patterns: `idx_invoices_currency_status ON invoices(currency, status)`, `idx_payment_transactions_gateway_id_status ON payment_transactions(payment_gateway_id, gateway_status)`, `idx_expenses_currency ON expenses(currency)`, `idx_contracts_client_facturar ON contracts(client_id, facturar)`, and `idx_suspension_logs_contract_created ON suspension_logs(contract_id, created_at)`. Each index is guarded via `INFORMATION_SCHEMA.STATISTICS` in a stored procedure for safe re-runs. Note: `webhook_deliveries.next_retry_at` already has a single-column index from migration 109.

> **Migration 130 — FireRelay nodes:** `130_create_firerelay_nodes_table.sql` creates the `firerelay_nodes` table — a registry of all nodes in a FireRelay cluster. Only used when `FIRERELAY_MODE = master`. Tracks node ID, API URL, status (active/draining/maintenance/offline), resource metrics (CPU %, memory %, disk %, DB size), client and device counts, uptime, and last-seen heartbeat.

> **Migration 131 — FireRelay client routing:** `131_create_firerelay_client_routing_table.sql` creates the `firerelay_client_routing` table — maps each `client_id` to the FireRelay node that owns it. Only used when `FIRERELAY_MODE = master`. Foreign key to `firerelay_nodes` with `ON DELETE RESTRICT`.

> **Migration 132 — Webhook events:** `132_create_webhook_events_table.sql` creates the `webhook_events` table for inbound payment gateway webhook events. Stores raw JSON payloads from Stripe, Conekta, and other providers with deduplication via unique `(provider, provider_event_id)` constraint. Tracks processing status (received/processing/processed/failed/ignored) and links to `payment_transactions` after reconciliation.

> **Migration 133 — Idempotency keys:** `133_create_idempotency_keys_table.sql` creates the `idempotency_keys` table for preventing duplicate payment charges. Stores client-supplied unique keys scoped per organization with cached HTTP response codes and bodies. Keys expire after 24 hours and are cleaned up by a scheduled task.

> **Migration 134 — Alert rules:** `134_create_alert_rules_table.sql` creates the `alert_rules` table for configurable monitoring alert rules per organization. Each rule defines a metric (cpu_usage, memory_usage, signal_strength, latency_ms, packet_loss, uptime), comparison operator, threshold, evaluation window in minutes, severity (info/warning/major/critical), optional auto-outage creation flag, and notification channels (email/SMS/SSE/webhook as JSON array).

> **Migration 135 — Alert events:** `135_create_alert_events_table.sql` creates the `alert_events` table — a log of triggered alert events. Records the firing alert rule, device, current vs threshold values, and lifecycle status (triggered/acknowledged/resolved) with acknowledgement and resolution timestamps.

> **Migration 136 — 2FA / TOTP ALTER:** `136_add_totp_to_users.sql` adds `totp_secret VARCHAR(255) NULL`, `totp_enabled BOOLEAN NOT NULL DEFAULT FALSE`, and `totp_backup_codes JSON NULL` to `users` for two-factor authentication support. Uses an idempotent stored procedure guard to skip if columns already exist.

> **Migration 137 — Data cap ALTER:** `137_add_data_cap_to_plans.sql` adds `data_cap_gb DECIMAL(10,2) NULL` to `plans` for monthly data cap in GB (NULL = unlimited). Uses an idempotent stored procedure guard.

> **Migration 138 — Seed alert evaluation task:** `138_seed_alert_evaluation_task.sql` inserts the `alert_evaluation` scheduled task (cron `*/5 * * * *`) that evaluates monitoring alert rules against current SNMP metrics every 5 minutes.

> **Migration 139 — Seed recurring charge task:** `139_seed_recurring_charge_task.sql` inserts the `process_recurring_charges` scheduled task (cron `0 7 * * *`) that auto-charges active recurring payment profiles with pending invoices daily at 07:00.

> **Migration 140 — Login lockout ALTER:** `140_add_login_lockout_to_users.sql` adds `failed_login_attempts TINYINT UNSIGNED NOT NULL DEFAULT 0` and `locked_until TIMESTAMP NULL` to `users` for brute-force account lockout protection.

> **Migration 141 — Composite indexes (batch 2):** `141_add_composite_indexes.sql` adds ten composite indexes for high-traffic query patterns: `idx_invoices_client_created`, `idx_invoices_status_due`, `idx_payments_contract_date`, `idx_payments_client_created`, `idx_connection_logs_contract_start`, `idx_tickets_client_status`, `idx_tickets_assigned_status`, `idx_webhook_deliveries_status_created`, `idx_audit_logs_entity_type_id`, and `idx_contracts_client_status`.

> **Migration 142 — Webhook dead letter ALTER:** `142_add_webhook_dead_letter.sql` adds `dead_letter` to the `webhook_deliveries.status` ENUM for deliveries that have exhausted all retry attempts. Adds `idx_webhook_deliveries_dead_letter` index for dead-letter dashboard queries.

> **Migration 143 — Optimistic locking ALTER:** `143_add_version_columns.sql` adds `version INT UNSIGNED NOT NULL DEFAULT 1` to `invoices`, `contracts`, `payments`, and `clients` for optimistic concurrency control.

> **Migration 144 — Billing period uniqueness:** `144_add_billing_period_unique_constraint.sql` adds a unique composite index `uq_billing_period_contract_dates (contract_id, period_start, period_end)` to `billing_periods` to prevent duplicate invoices for the same contract and billing period.

> **Migration 145 — Seed data retention task:** `145_seed_data_retention_task.sql` inserts the `data_retention` scheduled task (cron `0 3 * * *`). The current retention service purges configured high-volume logs, including RADIUS post-auth and PPPoE diagnostics telemetry, in 1,000-row batches across the primary database and every active isolated tenant database.

> **Migration 146 — Credit note invoice cap triggers:** `146_credit_note_invoice_total_guard_trigger.sql` adds BEFORE INSERT / BEFORE UPDATE triggers on `credit_notes` that prevent the sum of credit note totals (excluding cancelled) from exceeding the linked invoice total. Raises SQLSTATE '45000' on over-credit.

> **Migration 147 — Audit log no-update/no-delete triggers:** `147_audit_log_immutability_triggers.sql` adds BEFORE UPDATE / BEFORE DELETE triggers on `audit_logs` that reject ordinary row modification or removal with SQLSTATE '45000'. MySQL administrative privileges do not bypass these triggers; the current ordinary retention DELETE conflicts with them, and organization cascades/privileged schema changes remain separate integrity boundaries. See `LEGAL-GAP-003` in the [legal register](docs/legal-regulatory-register.md).

> **Migration 148 — CFDI document immutability trigger:** `148_cfdi_document_immutability_trigger.sql` adds a BEFORE UPDATE trigger on `cfdi_documents` that prevents modification of stamped (`sat_status = 'vigente'`) documents' financial fields (subtotal, total, UUID, XML, receptor data, etc.) per SAT Anexo 20. Only `sat_status` changes (for the cancellation flow) and non-financial metadata (pdf_url, updated_at) remain modifiable. Raises SQLSTATE '45000'.

> **Migration 149 — Contract status FSM trigger:** `149_contract_status_fsm_trigger.sql` adds a BEFORE UPDATE trigger on `contracts` that enforces valid status transitions: `pending → active|cancelled`, `active → expired|cancelled`. Both `expired` and `cancelled` are terminal states. Raises SQLSTATE '45000' on invalid transitions.

> **Migration 150 — Outage temporal logic triggers:** `150_outage_temporal_logic_trigger.sql` adds BEFORE INSERT / BEFORE UPDATE triggers on `outages` that ensure `resolved_at` is always after `started_at` when set. Prevents nonsensical duration calculations and corrupt SLA/uptime reporting. Raises SQLSTATE '45000'.

> **Migration 151 — Soft-delete columns:** `151_add_soft_delete_columns.sql` adds a nullable `deleted_at DATETIME` column and a corresponding index to 62 resource tables (users, clients, contracts, invoices, payments, devices, tickets, and all other major entities). Enables archive-on-delete instead of hard `DELETE`, preserving data integrity and audit trails. The `BaseModel.delete()` method sets `deleted_at = NOW()` while `forceDelete()` performs a hard delete; `restore()` clears the column.

> **Migration 152 — Refresh token rotation:** `152_add_refresh_token_rotation.sql` adds a `token_family VARCHAR(255)` column and index to `user_sessions`. The family identifier links all refresh tokens issued from one login session, enabling server-side reuse detection: if an already-rotated token is presented, all sessions in the same family are revoked to mitigate refresh token theft.

> **Migration 153 — Payment retries table:** `153_create_payment_retries_table.sql` creates the `payment_retries` table that tracks failed payment charges and schedules automatic retry attempts. Each row represents a retry schedule for a failed `payment_transactions` record. Retries follow exponential backoff (4 h → 24 h → 72 h, 3 attempts maximum). Stores attempt count, next retry timestamp, last error, status (`pending` / `processing` / `succeeded` / `exhausted` / `cancelled`), and FK links to the original transaction, client, invoice, and recurring payment profile.

> **Migration 154 — Seed payment retry task:** `154_seed_payment_retry_task.sql` inserts the `retry_failed_charges` scheduled task (cron `0 * * * *` — hourly) that processes pending payment retries whose `next_retry_at` has passed. Uses `INSERT IGNORE` for idempotency.

> **Migration 155 — Seed billing cycle task:** `155_seed_billing_cycle_task.sql` inserts the `billing_cycle` scheduled task (cron `0 2 * * *` — daily at 02:00, priority `high`, timeout 600 s) that orchestrates the full automated revenue engine: auto-generate invoices → email invoice to client → send suspension warning emails for overdue contracts approaching the rule threshold → suspend contracts past the `days_past_due` limit and email post-suspension confirmation. Dispatched by `taskRunner.runBillingCycle()`. Uses `INSERT IGNORE` for idempotency.

> **Migration 156 — Seed database backup task:** `156_seed_database_backup_task.sql` inserts the `database_backup` scheduled task (cron `0 3 * * *` — daily at 03:00 UTC, priority `normal`, timeout 1800 s, 2 retries) that runs `mysqldump`, compresses the output with gzip, saves it locally in `storage/backups/` (retaining the last 7 copies), and uploads it to S3-compatible cloud storage (AWS S3 or Backblaze B2) when `BACKUP_S3_BUCKET`/`BACKUP_S3_REGION`/`BACKUP_S3_ACCESS_KEY`/`BACKUP_S3_SECRET_KEY` are configured. Cloud upload failure is non-fatal — the local copy is retained. Uses `INSERT IGNORE` for idempotency.

> **Migration 157 — Historical IFT-format schema alignment ALTER:** `157_align_ift_statistical_reports_with_ift_format.sql` adds fields selected by a 2026-04-21 engineering review of an IFT fixed-Internet format: `concession_title_id`, municipality/customer/payment breakdowns, and `notes`. The exact reviewed form version was not archived and former LFTR Article 175 is no longer current authority; revalidate the current CRT instrument/form before filing or UI/export reliance. See the [historical schema review](docs/ift-statistical-report-schema-review.md) and `MX-TEL-007` in the [legal register](docs/legal-regulatory-register.md).

> **Migration 158 — FireRelay node on devices + config backup task:** `158_add_firerelay_node_to_devices_and_seed_config_backup_task.sql` adds `firerelay_node_id VARCHAR(64) NULL` to `devices` (with `idx_devices_firerelay_node_id` index) — records which FireRelay agent can reach the device via the RouterOS API. No FK is added because the agent connection is the authoritative reachability source and standalone-mode deployments may have no `firerelay_nodes` rows. Also seeds the `config_backup_pull` scheduled task (cron `0 2 * * *`, daily at 02:00 UTC, 2 retries, 3600 s timeout) that pulls RouterOS `/export` configs from all devices with a `firerelay_node_id` and stores versioned snapshots in `device_config_backups` with SHA-256 deduplication. Uses `INSERT IGNORE` for idempotency.

> **Migration 159 — Auto-create ticket on alert:** `159_add_auto_create_ticket_to_alert_rules.sql` adds `auto_create_ticket BOOLEAN NOT NULL DEFAULT FALSE` to `alert_rules`. When enabled, the alert evaluation task automatically creates a support ticket for each triggered alert event with severity `critical` or `high`. The ticket is linked to the device, client, or site referenced in the alert and pre-populated with the alert threshold breach details.

> **Migration 160 — Portal credentials on clients:** `160_add_portal_credentials_to_clients.sql` adds `portal_email VARCHAR(255) NULL` (UNIQUE, nullable for clients without portal access) and `portal_password_hash VARCHAR(255) NULL` to `clients` for self-service portal authentication. Portal credentials are separate from administrative user credentials; clients can log in with their portal_email to view invoices, submit tickets, run speed tests, and manage payment methods.

> **Migration 161 — Portal refresh tokens table:** `161_create_portal_refresh_tokens_table.sql` creates the `portal_refresh_tokens` table that stores SHA-256 hashed refresh tokens for long-lived client portal authentication. Each row links to a `client_id`, includes an `expires_at` timestamp, and supports revocation via `revoked_at`. Complements the portal credentials added in migration 160; enables "remember me" sessions without exposing long-lived access tokens.

> **Migration 162 — Seed webhook retry task:** `162_seed_webhook_retry_task.sql` inserts the `webhook_retry` scheduled task (cron `*/10 * * * *` — every 10 minutes) that processes pending webhook deliveries whose `next_retry_at` has passed and status is `pending` or `retrying`. Implements exponential backoff (5 min → 15 min → 60 min → 6 h → 24 h, 5 attempts maximum). Uses `INSERT IGNORE` for idempotency.

> **Migration 163 — SNMP traps table:** `163_create_snmp_traps_table.sql` creates the `snmp_traps` table that stores unsolicited trap messages received from network devices. The receiver listens on UDP (port 1620 by default, configurable via `SNMP_TRAP_PORT`). Each attributed row captures the device IP, trap type (coldStart, warmStart, linkDown, linkUp, authenticationFailure, egpNeighborLoss, enterpriseSpecific, unknown), raw OID, timestamp, variable bindings (varbinds) as JSON, and an optional link to a known device. Migration 459 stops retaining SNMP communities, limits ordinary list responses to metadata, protects raw varbind detail with `snmp_traps.payload.view`, and adds a batched 180-day product-default purge (`RETENTION_SNMP_TRAPS_DAYS`) to bound this operational log.

> **Migration 164 — DR drill logs table + quarterly task:** `164_create_dr_drill_logs.sql` creates the `dr_drill_logs` table to record the outcome of each automated quarterly DR-drill run (Phase 1: backup + size verification, Phase 4: referential-integrity + financial-consistency checks). The drill is NON-DESTRUCTIVE — Phases 2 (drop) and 3 (restore) remain manual per `docs/dr-drill.md`. Also seeds the `quarterly_dr_drill` scheduled task (cron `0 2 1 1,4,7,10 *` — 02:00 on 1 Jan / 1 Apr / 1 Jul / 1 Oct, 1 retry, 3600 s timeout). Drill results (pass/fail/error) and an overdue flag are surfaced in the admin frontend on every login for compliance visibility.

> **Migration 165 — SSO configuration tables (P2.1):** `165_create_sso_configs.sql` creates three tables for per-organization single sign-on:
> - **`organization_sso_configs`** — one row per `(organization_id, provider_type)` (SAML 2.0 or OIDC); holds all IdP connection settings (SAML entity ID / SSO URL / SLO URL / X.509 cert / SP private key; OIDC issuer / client ID / client secret), attribute-mapping JSON, auto-provisioning flag, and the default role assigned to new SSO users. Unique constraint on `(organization_id, provider_type)`.
> - **`organization_sso_group_mappings`** — maps exact IdP group names to VigaBSS roles; evaluated at login to give authenticated users their correct role. Unique constraint on `(sso_config_id, idp_group)`.
> - **`sso_auth_states`** — short-lived OIDC state/nonce store for the authorization-code flow; rows expire after 10 minutes and should be purged by a cleanup task. Unique constraint on `state`.

> **Migration 166 — Per-tenant resource quotas:** `166_create_organization_quotas.sql` creates the `organization_quotas` table that stores optional upper bounds per organization for four resources: `max_clients` (active client records), `max_devices` (active device records), `max_storage_mb` (sum of all org-owned `files.file_size`), and `max_scheduled_tasks` (org-scoped scheduled task rows). A `NULL` value in any limit column means "unlimited" for that resource. A row is created only when a quota is first configured; the absence of a row is also treated as unlimited. The `checkQuota` middleware enforces these limits at the API layer before the relevant creation handlers. Unique constraint on `organization_id`.

> **Migration 167 — Per-tenant database isolation config:** `167_create_organization_database_configs.sql` creates the `organization_database_configs` control-plane table. One row per organization (unique constraint). Stores `isolation_mode` (`shared` default, `isolated` opt-in), isolated database host, port, name, user, AES-256-GCM-encrypted password (`db_password_encrypted`), SSL flag, and `last_verified_at` timestamp. When `isolation_mode = 'isolated'` and a valid connection config is present, `src/config/database.js` routes every DB operation for that organization to a dedicated MySQL pool (cached in memory, invalidated on config update). Admin endpoints: `GET/PUT /api/v1/organizations/:id/database-isolation` (masked config), `POST /api/v1/organizations/:id/database-isolation/test` (connectivity check + records `last_verified_at`). `FK ON DELETE CASCADE` from `organizations`.

> **Migration 168 — PROFECO-related complaint tracking:** `168_create_profeco_complaints_table.sql` creates an internal complaint-support table with operator-entered folio/contact/category/status/deadline/resolution fields and optional client/ticket links. Its CSV/JSON output is generic; VigaBSS does not establish CONCILIANET applicability, an official filing format, a quarterly duty, submission, or acceptance.

> **Migration 169 — AI Reply Assistant tables + device/link columns:** `169_ai_assistant.sql` creates six tables for the AI Reply Assistant feature (`ai_policies`, `ai_providers`, `ai_phrase_library`, `ai_forbidden_terms`, `ai_reply_logs`, `contract_topology_paths`) and adds two ALTER TABLE statements: `devices.role ENUM('cpe','pop','backbone','border','access') NULL` for topology classification, and `network_links.medium ENUM('fiber','wireless','copper') NULL` + `network_links.role ENUM('backbone','distribution','access','client') NULL` for link metadata used by `topologyContextService`.

> **Migration 170 — AI cost roll-up columns on organization_quotas:** `170_ai_cost_rollup.sql` adds `max_ai_tokens_month BIGINT UNSIGNED NULL` (monthly token budget; NULL = unlimited), `ai_cost_month_usd DECIMAL(10,4) NOT NULL DEFAULT 0` (running cost accumulator reset monthly by the `aiCostRollupWorker`), and `ai_cost_rollup_month DATE NULL` (date of the last roll-up) to `organization_quotas`.

> **Migration 171 — AI RBAC permissions seed:** `171_seed_ai_permissions.sql` inserts the seven granular AI permission slugs (`ai.policy.read`, `ai.policy.write`, `ai.phrases.read`, `ai.phrases.write`, `ai.reply.draft`, `ai.reply.send`, `ai.providers.write`) into `permissions` and grants them to the `admin` role via `role_permissions`. Uses `INSERT IGNORE` for idempotent re-runs.

> **Migration 172 — `embedding_model` on ai_providers:** `172_add_embedding_model_to_ai_providers.sql` adds `embedding_model VARCHAR(120) NULL` to `ai_providers`. When populated and `VECTOR_RETRIEVAL_ENABLED=true`, the `vectorStoreService` uses this model via `llmProviderService.embed()` to generate embeddings for ChromaDB upserts and similarity queries in the RAG pipeline.

> **Migration 266 — FTTH OLT & ONU management tables (§7.1/§7.2):** `266_create_ftth_olt_onu_tables.sql` creates seven FTTH-specific tables: `olt_ports` (PON/uplink port inventory per OLT, with Tx/Rx optical power and ONU count), `onu_profiles` (service profile templates: T-CONT/GEM port/DBA/VLAN mapping), `onu_details` (per-ONU provisioning detail extending the `devices` row: SN, LOID/Password encrypted, state, ranging distance, profile assignment, WAN mode), `onu_optical_metrics` (per-ONU optical diagnostic time-series: Tx power, Rx power, temperature, voltage, bias current), `onu_whitelist` (MAC/SN allow-block list per OLT), `onu_omci_configs` (OMCI-style Wi-Fi SSID/password and WAN config records — delivery via OMCI/TR-069/SSH-CLI job layer), and `onu_firmware_jobs` (batch firmware upgrade and reboot scheduler: scoped to single ONU, PON port, or full OLT). OLTs and ONUs are existing device records (`type='olt'/'onu'`); these tables add GPON domain detail without a parallel device registry.

> **Migration 267 — FTTH vendor capability profiles + splitter inventory (§7.1):** `267_create_ftth_vendor_splitter_tables.sql` creates `olt_vendor_capabilities` (global per-vendor capability matrix mapping vendor/model to supported protocols, SNMP profile, CLI template names, NETCONF schema, OMCI flag, and enterprise OID root — seeds rows for Huawei MA5800/EA5800, ZTE C300/C320/C600, VSOL V1600, C-Data 1600/9000, WOLCK WNM, and Calix E7) and `olt_splitters` (PON splitter inventory: 1:2 through 1:128 ratios, linked to site and OLT port). Also adds the deferred `fk_onu_details_provision_job` FK on `onu_details.last_provision_job_id → onu_firmware_jobs` via guarded stored procedure.

Admin gets all 8; technician gets utilization/power_budget/shutdown/configure_mode + onu_migration_jobs.view/create; readonly gets utilization/power_budget + onu_migration_jobs.view.

> **Migration 272 — Fiber Plant Management tables (§7.4):** `272_fiber_plant_management.sql` creates 6 new tables: `fiber_routes` (CO→splitter→ONU path hierarchy with parent_route_id self-FK, GIS path JSON, from/to device/port/ONU/splitter FKs), `odf_frames` (ODF physical inventory per site), `odf_ports` (port records within a frame, UNIQUE on frame+port_number, CASCADE on frame delete), `odf_cross_connects` (patch cord records between two ODF ports, RESTRICT deletes), `otdr_test_results` (fault detection records with fault_type ENUM, events JSON, sor_file_path; live I/O = honest stub), `sfp_inventory` (SFP lifecycle: installed/spare/faulty/retired; links to devices and inventory_items; DDM diagnostics via existing snmp_metrics sfp_* columns from migration 255).

> **Migration 273 — Fiber Plant Management permissions (§7.4):** `273_seed_fiber_plant_permissions.sql` seeds 24 permissions covering `fiber_routes.*` (4), `odf_frames.*` (4), `odf_ports.*` (4), `odf_cross_connects.*` (4), `otdr_tests.*` (4), `sfp_inventory.*` (4). Admin gets all 24; technician gets all views + fiber_routes/odf/sfp create+update + otdr_tests.create (16 total); readonly gets all 6 *.view permissions.

> **Migration 274–276 — CPE Management & Profiles (§8.1/§8.2):** `274_cpe_devices_and_tasks.sql` creates `cpe_devices` (TR-069/CWMP CPE registry with HTTP Basic ACS auth, status machine new→provisioning→active/error/offline), `cpe_parameters` (parameter tree storage, UNIQUE on device+path), and `cpe_tasks` (CWMP task queue with 8 task_type values, priority 1–10). `275_cpe_profiles_and_firmware.sql` creates `cpe_profiles` (provisioning templates with self-referencing parent_profile_id for up to 5-level inheritance, plan auto-apply, WiFi/WAN config fields), `cpe_parameter_mappings` (static/contract/plan/device-field source rules), `cpe_firmware_versions` (manufacturer+model+version unique, checksum types), and `cpe_firmware_campaigns` (batch firmware push with device targeting by manufacturer/model/profile/ad-hoc IDs). `276_cpe_fk_permissions_seeds.sql` wires the deferred FK `fk_cpe_devices_cpe_profile` via INFORMATION_SCHEMA-guarded procedure, seeds 26 permissions across `cpe_management.*` (8) and `cpe_profiles.*` (6), grants admin all 26, and seeds 8 vendor default profiles (TP-Link, ZTE, Huawei, Fiberhome, VSOL, D-Link, Netis, Tenda).

> **Migrations 284–285 — RF Metrics + Spectrum Scans (§9.3):** `284_rf_spectrum_scan_tables.sql` creates `spectrum_scan_results` table (scan_type ENUM, frequency range, scan_data JSON array of {freq_mhz, power_dbm}, peak_interference_dbm, recommended_channel_mhz, status ENUM); adds GPS sync OIDs for Ubiquiti airOS (ubntAirIfGpsSync 1.3.6.1.4.1.41112.1.6.1.2.1.5) and Mimosa Networks (mimosaGpsSync 1.3.6.1.4.1.43356.2.1.2.1.1.8); seeds `wireless_ap_sector_poll` scheduled task (every 5 minutes, snmp_poll type). `285_seed_rf_metrics_permissions.sql` seeds 4 permissions: spectrum_scans.view/create/delete + rf_metrics.view.

### Venta al Público en General (Factura Pública)

Mexican tax law (SAT CFDI 4.0) requires every sale to be fiscally documented, even when the client does not request an individual factura. For MX-locale contracts where the client opts out of individual CFDIs, the ISP uses the **"venta al público en general"** mechanism:

1. **Per-contract `facturar` flag:** Each contract has a `facturar` BOOLEAN column (default `FALSE`). Set to `TRUE` when the client wants an individual CFDI for that contract's invoices, `FALSE` when they do not. The same client can have some contracts with `facturar = TRUE` and others with `facturar = FALSE`.

2. **Client MX profile requirement:** If ANY of a client's contracts has `facturar = TRUE`, the client MUST have a `client_mx_profiles` row with valid SAT data (RFC, razon_social, regimen_fiscal, codigo_postal_fiscal). This is enforced at the application layer. If ALL contracts have `facturar = FALSE`, the profile is optional.

3. **RFC uniqueness:** A stored generated column (`rfc_unique_check`) evaluates to `NULL` for `XAXX010101000` and to the actual RFC otherwise. The UNIQUE constraint on this column allows multiple público-en-general profiles while still enforcing uniqueness for real RFCs.

4. **Normal invoicing continues:** Invoices are still created for `facturar = FALSE` contracts (for internal billing, collection, and payment tracking), but no individual CFDI is stamped for them.

5. **Periodic factura pública aggregation:** All invoices from `facturar = FALSE` contracts are aggregated into a periodic factura pública document (`factura_publica_invoices`) per the SAT `InformacionGlobal` node requirements:
   - **Periodicidad** (`c_Periodicidad`): `01`=Diario, `02`=Semanal, `03`=Quincenal, `04`=Mensual, `05`=Bimestral
   - **Meses** (`c_Meses`): `01`–`12` individual months; `13`–`18` bimonthly periods
   - **Año**: Fiscal year

6. **Invoice-to-factura-pública linking:** The `factura_publica_invoice_items` junction table links each invoice to its parent factura pública. Each invoice can belong to at most one factura pública (enforced by UNIQUE constraint on `invoice_id`).

7. **Factura pública receptor data:** When the factura pública is stamped, the `cfdi_documents` receptor snapshot uses: RFC `XAXX010101000`, Nombre `PUBLICO EN GENERAL`, RegimenFiscal `616` (Sin obligaciones fiscales), UsoCFDI `S01` (Sin efectos fiscales).

8. **Predominant FormaPago calculation (migration 091):** Every CFDI 4.0 requires exactly one `FormaPago` code. When a factura pública aggregates invoices paid via different methods, call `fn_predominant_forma_pago(factura_publica_invoice_id)` at stamp time to obtain the correct code. The function sums `payments.amount` grouped by `sat_forma_pago` and returns the code with the highest total. If two or more codes tie, or if no payments are recorded, it returns `'99'` (Por definir) per SAT Anexo 20 rules.

9. **Unpaid invoice exclusion (migration 091):** Only invoices with `status = 'paid'` may be included in a stamped factura pública. This is enforced by two database-level safeguards: a BEFORE INSERT trigger on `factura_publica_invoice_items` rejects linking any invoice that is not yet paid, and a BEFORE UPDATE trigger on `factura_publica_invoices` blocks transitioning `status` to `'stamped'` if any linked invoice is not paid. Both raise SQLSTATE '45000' on violation. This prevents the ISP from paying taxes on revenue it has not yet collected.

> **This feature only applies to MX-locale clients.** The existing locale enforcement triggers (migration 087) prevent CFDI documents from being created for non-MX clients. Non-MX clients are not affected by the `facturar` flag.

### Storage Folders

The `storage/` directory holds user-uploaded and system-generated files organized by entity type. The `files` database table stores metadata and paths for every stored file.

| Folder | Entity Type | File Categories |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|
| `storage/devices/` | Devices | device_history, evidence |
| `storage/clients/` | Clients | client_file, notification_log |
| `storage/tickets/` | Tickets | chat_history, document |
| `storage/organizations/` | Organizations | isp_info, sat, online_payment, map, logo |
| `storage/backups/` | System | backup |

## Getting Started

### Connection Types

Each contract specifies a `connection_type` that determines how the client connects and whether RADIUS is required:

| Connection Type | Description | RADIUS Required | IP Management |
|-----------------|-------------|-----------------|---------------|
| `pppoe` (default) | PPPoE session — IPv4 only via RADIUS | Yes — create a `radius` record linked to the contract | `radius.ip_address` (static) or `radius.ipv4_pool_id` pool-assigned (dynamic) |
| `pppoe_dual` | PPPoE session — dual-stack IPv4 + IPv6 via RADIUS | Yes — create a `radius` record with IPv4 and IPv6 fields | `radius.ip_address` + `radius.ipv6_address` / `radius.ipv6_delegated_prefix` (static) or pool-assigned via `radius.ipv4_pool_id` + `radius.ipv6_pool_id` (dynamic) |
| `static` | Static IPv4 — IP assigned directly, no PPPoE | No | `ip_assignments` row linked to the contract via `contract_id` |
| `dual` | Dual-stack static IPv4 + IPv6 — no PPPoE | No | One IPv4 + one IPv6 `ip_assignments` row, both linked to the contract |

### IPv4 / IPv6 / Dual-Stack Support

The schema is ready for IPv4-only, IPv6-only, and dual-stack deployments:

| Table | IPv4 | IPv6 | Dual-Stack Notes |
|-------|------|------|------------------|
| `ip_pools` | `ip_version = '4'` | `ip_version = '6'` | Create separate pools per address family; link both to the same site |
| `ip_assignments` | Single address (`prefix_len` = NULL) | Address or prefix (`prefix_len` = 48, 56, 64, …) | One row per address/prefix; a dual-stack subscriber gets one v4 + one v6 assignment |
| `radius` | `ip_address` (static) or `ipv4_pool_id` (dynamic) | `ipv6_address` + `ipv6_delegated_prefix` / `ipv6_prefix_len` (static) or `ipv6_pool_id` (dynamic) | All IPv6 fields coexist with IPv4 for seamless dual-stack PPPoE sessions; `nas_id` links the subscriber to its NAS |
| `nas` | `ip_address` | `ipv6_address` | Both addresses stored per NAS for dual-stack management |
| `devices` | `ip_address` | `ipv6_address` | Both addresses stored per device for dual-stack management |

### SNMP Monitoring

The `devices` table includes SNMP configuration columns (`snmp_enabled`, `snmp_community`, `snmp_version`, `snmp_port`) so that both **client CPE** and **POP infrastructure** devices can be polled. Collected metrics are stored in a three-tier structure for efficient querying and long-term retention:

| Data Tier | Resolution | Retention | Description |
|-----------|------------|-----------|-------------|
| `snmp_metrics` (raw) | 5-min polls | 90 days | Wide table — one row per device/interface per poll (8× fewer rows than narrow EAV); monthly partitions enable instant `DROP PARTITION` retention |
| `snmp_metrics_1hr` | Hourly averages | 1 year | Wide table — per-metric `avg_*` / `min_*` / `max_*` columns; idempotent rollup via `INSERT … ON DUPLICATE KEY UPDATE` |
| `snmp_metrics_1day` | Daily averages | 3+ years | Wide table — aggregated from `snmp_metrics_1hr`; kept indefinitely |

#### Supported SNMP Metrics

Each raw poll row stores up to eight metrics as individual columns:

| Column | Type | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| `if_in_octets` | `BIGINT` | ifInOctets — bytes received |
| `if_out_octets` | `BIGINT` | ifOutOctets — bytes transmitted |
| `if_in_errors` | `BIGINT` | ifInErrors — inbound error count |
| `if_out_errors` | `BIGINT` | ifOutErrors — outbound error count |
| `cpu_usage` | `SMALLINT` | CPU utilization percentage |
| `memory_usage` | `SMALLINT` | Memory utilization percentage |
| `signal_strength` | `INTEGER` | Wireless signal strength in dBm |
| `latency_ms` | `DECIMAL(10,2)` | ICMP ping latency in milliseconds |

The optional `interface_id` column stores the SNMP `ifIndex` or `ifDescr` for interface-level metrics (e.g., multiple interfaces on a router or switch).

#### Scale Targets

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Devices | 6,000 |
| Poll interval | 5 minutes |
| Rows per day (raw) | ~1.73 million |
| Raw retention | 90 days (~155 million rows) |
| Raw table design | Wide — no FK, no per-row OID, monthly partitions |

#### Automated Rollup & Retention (MySQL Event Scheduler)

Data aggregation and retention are handled by MySQL stored procedures and scheduled events — the MySQL equivalent of TimescaleDB continuous aggregates and retention policies. The MySQL Event Scheduler must be enabled:

```sql
SET GLOBAL event_scheduler = ON;
```

Or in `my.cnf` / `my.ini`:

```ini
[mysqld]
event_scheduler = ON
```

> **⚠️ Prerequisite:** `event_scheduler = ON` is **required** for automated SNMP rollup/retention and partition creation for `connection_logs` and `radius_accounting_events`. If it is disabled, SNMP aggregation stops and new partitioned accounting/evidence rows accumulate in the `p_future` catch-all. CGNAT binding tables are indexed but not monthly partitioned. The application retention task—not a partition-drop event—owns deletion of expired connection records. Run the preflight check procedure (see [Preflight Check](#preflight-check-event-scheduler)) during deployment.

| Event | Schedule | Action |
|-------|----------|--------|
| `evt_snmp_rollup_1hr` | Every hour at :05 | Calls `snmp_rollup_to_1hr()` — aggregates raw → hourly using high-watermark |
| `evt_snmp_rollup_1day` | Daily at 00:30 | Calls `snmp_rollup_to_1day()` — aggregates hourly → daily using high-watermark |
| `evt_snmp_retention` | Daily at 02:00 | Calls `snmp_apply_retention()` — purges hourly data older than 1 year |
| `evt_snmp_partition_maintenance` | Daily at 03:00 | Calls `snmp_maintain_partitions()` — adds future month partitions and drops expired ones (replaces batch DELETE for raw data retention) |

All rollup procedures use a **high-watermark** (`snmp_rollup_state` table) to track the last successfully processed timestamp, so missed runs catch up automatically rather than only looking back a fixed window. Rollup procedures use `INSERT … ON DUPLICATE KEY UPDATE` for idempotent re-runs. Raw data retention is instant (partition `DROP`) while hourly retention uses batch deletes (10 000 rows per iteration) since that table is much smaller.

### Connection Logging, Evidence, and Operational Usage

`connection_logs` is the mutable current/final projection of a subscriber
session. Supported application ingest creates one row per lifecycle, then
Start/Interim/Stop receipts advance that row's state, cumulative counters and
last-received time. It is not one immutable row per accounting packet.

`radius_accounting_events` separately retains selected normalized lifecycle
milestones: Start, the first transition to Interim, Stop, and a later corrected
final Stop when applicable. It deliberately does not retain every routine
Interim heartbeat or the raw RADIUS packet. Its dedupe key and integrity hash
support replay and consistency checks; they do not make it tamper-proof against
a privileged database operator or a complete statutory evidence vault.

`radius_accounting_usage_daily` contains monotonic counter deltas grouped by
the normalized accounting event's UTC date. It is an operational rollup, not
packet-level metering: counter resets, a non-zero first observation, a newly
appearing counter, or an interval crossing UTC midnight marks the lifecycle or
day incomplete and records an anomaly. Billing, FUP, rollover, or legal users
must inspect `is_complete`, `anomaly_count`, and `anomaly_reason` and fail closed
when exact attribution matters. Deprecated direct-SQL `connection_logs` writers
do not populate this rollup and are not a supported billing source.

`cgnat_attribution_bindings` holds privacy-minimal translation or port-allocation
evidence submitted by an operator-controlled external collector: private source
tuple, translated public source address and port/range, protocol, exact UTC
allocation interval, gateway/exporter provenance, and the canonical
`session_instance_id` returned by tenant RADIUS ingest. Every allocate/release
event requires that tenant-owned session UUID; optional subscriber hints or a
reused private address cannot replace it. The dataset deliberately has no
destination address/port, URL, domain, DNS, packet payload, application content,
or browsing-history field. VigaBSS does not parse RouterOS, NetFlow/IPFIX, or
syslog itself.

The LMTR does not expressly enumerate CGNAT address/port bindings. This is an
operator/counsel-configured attribution control, not automatic compliance from
selecting the `MX` locale. A unique lookup supports attribution to a subscriber
account and access session; it does not prove which human used the connection,
what they did, or which destination they contacted. Missing and overlapping
bindings must be reported as unavailable or ambiguous rather than guessed.
For a directly assigned public IPv4 address, public IP plus UTC time resolves
only through a certain RADIUS evidence interval: the first exact-IP lifecycle
event and receipt establish the lower bound, while both the closure/latest
event and its receipt establish the upper bound. Translated port and protocol
are required only when a public address is shared behind CGNAT.
The CGNAT mode is supported only when a public IP/port/protocol tuple is
exclusive to one subscriber at an instant. Translators that reuse the tuple and
need remote destination for disambiguation are reported unsupported; VigaBSS
does not collect destinations to compensate.
An exporter epoch with a reported sequence/loss/metadata incident remains
fail-closed. After authoritative external reconciliation, retire that identity
and start a newly versioned exporter identity/epoch; do not reset its historical
counters or make old-epoch evidence appear healthy.
Raw device time is corrected by subtracting `clock_offset_ms` (raw device time
minus UTC), and only corrected time minus uncertainty advances the certain
coverage horizon. V1 has no heartbeat/checkpoint: quiet exporters become stale,
and an open mapping or long-lived port block alone does not remain continuously
attributable. A new or returning boot identifier never resumes an existing
epoch; drain/reconcile/rebaseline the pool and register a newly versioned
exporter identity/configuration epoch.
The synchronous HTTP/MySQL path is for assessed low-volume mappings or
deterministic exclusive port blocks. Carrier-scale per-connection streams need
a durable queue/normalizer, dedicated partitioned append/search store, and
measured end-to-end loss/backlog; an accepted HTTP batch is not proof of complete
network coverage.

Retention defaults are 24 calendar months for the projection, lifecycle
evidence, usage rollup, and CGNAT bindings. The operator and counsel must approve
the actual CGNAT schedule because locale alone supplies no legal basis. Ordinary
CGNAT retention is configurable from 1–24 calendar months and is hard-capped at
24 for minimization; only an active scoped case hold may preserve evidence
longer.
`CGNAT_ATTRIBUTION_RETENTION_MONTHS` is installation-wide, so the selected
period must be approved for every tenant that enables collection; tenants that
require different periods need separate deployments until per-organization
retention exists. The
application `purge_radius_accounting` task deletes expired rows in bounded
batches across shared and active isolated databases; only explicitly preserved,
case-linked evidence may bypass ordinary deletion. Partition events materialize
current and future partitions but do not replace the policy-aware purge.

| Event | Schedule | Action |
|-------|----------|--------|
| `evt_connection_logs_partition_maintenance` | Daily at 03:30 | Materializes current through +3 month `connection_logs` partitions; does not drop records |
| `evt_subscriber_logging_partition_maintenance` | Daily at 03:00 | Materializes current through +3 month `radius_accounting_events` partitions; does not drop records |

Every direct query must include the owning `organization_id`. Prefer the
tenant-scoped APIs and audited exports over ad-hoc SQL. Configuration, collector
limits, access controls, completeness caveats, and production acceptance steps
are in [Connection Logging and Evidence Operations](docs/connection-logging-compliance.md).

### Preflight Check: Event Scheduler

Migration `053` creates a `preflight_check_event_scheduler()` stored procedure that validates the MySQL Event Scheduler is enabled. Call it during deployment or application startup:

```sql
CALL preflight_check_event_scheduler();
```

If `event_scheduler` is **not** `ON`, the procedure raises a `SQLSTATE '45000'` error with a descriptive message explaining the risk and how to fix it. It returns silently when the scheduler is correctly enabled.

**Why this matters:**

| Consequence | Detail |
|-------------|--------|
| Partition-layout drift | Without daily partition maintenance, new `connection_logs`/accounting-evidence rows accumulate in `p_future`; later reorganization can become expensive and monthly operational checks are no longer meaningful |
| Retention drift | A disabled/failed application retention task leaves expired connection records in place; the partition creator does not delete them |
| SNMP data gap | Rollup and retention events stop running, leaving raw data unbounded |

**To enable the Event Scheduler:**

```sql
-- At runtime (resets on MySQL restart unless also set in my.cnf):
SET GLOBAL event_scheduler = ON;
```

```ini
# In my.cnf / my.ini (persistent across restarts):
[mysqld]
event_scheduler = ON
```

### SNMP OID Profile System

The SNMP OID profile system lets you customize which OIDs are polled for each device brand and model without changing any application code — just insert new rows into the profile tables.

#### How Profiles Work

Each `snmp_profiles` row is a named polling template. A device is polled only when SNMP is enabled and `devices.snmp_profile_id` explicitly references a profile. The poller walks every active OID listed in `snmp_profile_oids` for that profile and stores each result in the corresponding `snmp_metrics` wide-table column (`metric_column`).

#### Profile Assignment

For every device where `snmp_enabled = TRUE`, set a profile explicitly in the Device Map create/edit dialog. A blank profile means **not polled**, even when a matching manufacturer/model or a default profile exists. Device discovery may suggest a profile while onboarding a discovered device, but the regular polling loop does not auto-match or fall back at runtime. This explicit assignment keeps a firmware-specific OID template from being applied to the wrong radio family.

#### Pre-Seeded Profiles

| Profile | `manufacturer` | Key Vendor OIDs |
|---------|---------------|-----------------|
| **Generic IF-MIB** *(default)* | `NULL` (any) | Standard IF-MIB (RFC 2863) interface counters + HOST-RESOURCES-MIB CPU/memory |
| **Ubiquiti airOS** | `Ubiquiti` | Enterprise `1.3.6.1.4.1.41112.*` OIDs for signal strength, CPU, memory |
| **MikroTik RouterOS** | `MikroTik` | Enterprise `1.3.6.1.4.1.14988.*` OID for wireless signal + HOST-RESOURCES-MIB |
| **Cambium Networks** | `Cambium` | Enterprise `1.3.6.1.4.1.161.*` OIDs for RSSI and CPU |
| **Mimosa B-series PTP** | `Mimosa` | B5/C5 product-MIB temperature, total Rx power, chain-1 noise/SNR, five-second Tx/Rx throughput + IF-MIB/IF-X-MIB |
| **Mimosa C5c PTP** | `Mimosa` | B5/C5 product-MIB total Rx power, chain-1 noise/SNR, temperature, five-second Tx/Rx throughput + IF-MIB/IF-X-MIB |

#### Mimosa PTP Setup and Verification

1. On both ends of the link, enable read-only SNMPv2c and restrict UDP/161 access to the poller network.
2. In the Device Map editor, enable SNMP, enter the community and port, and explicitly select **Mimosa B-series PTP** or **Mimosa C5c PTP** to match the installed firmware family.
3. Before relying on alerts, verify the live agent from the poller host. At minimum, walk `1.3.6.1.2.1.1.3`, `1.3.6.1.2.1.31.1.1.1`, and `1.3.6.1.4.1.43356.2.1.2`; then confirm fresh readings on the SNMP Metrics page.

Mimosa's [current SNMP download page](https://client.help.mimosa.co/snmp-mib-downloads-client) identifies this as the B5 and C5 product MIB, and a C5c-specific field template corroborates the instances. Still confirm signal, noise, and SNR against the exact deployed PTP firmware before making them alert-critical. The profile deliberately records chain 1 instead of pretending an unfiltered multi-chain average is valid. CCQ, airtime utilization, and GPS sync remain empty because no trustworthy C5c PTP mappings were found; do not invent them solely because the enterprise prefix matches.

#### Adding a New Vendor Profile

To add a new brand or model without touching any code:

```sql
-- 1. Create the profile
INSERT INTO snmp_profiles (name, manufacturer, model_pattern, device_type, snmp_version, poll_interval_sec, description)
VALUES ('Huawei OLT', 'Huawei', NULL, 'olt', 'v2c', 300, 'Huawei OLT devices — MA5800 series');

-- 2. Map the OIDs
INSERT INTO snmp_profile_oids (profile_id, oid, metric_column, label, oid_type, is_per_interface, sort_order)
VALUES
    (LAST_INSERT_ID(), '1.3.6.1.2.1.2.2.1.10', 'if_in_octets',  'Inbound Octets',  'counter', TRUE,  10),
    (LAST_INSERT_ID(), '1.3.6.1.2.1.2.2.1.16', 'if_out_octets', 'Outbound Octets', 'counter', TRUE,  20),
    (LAST_INSERT_ID(), '1.3.6.1.4.1.2011.6.128.1.1.2.51.1.4', 'cpu_usage', 'Huawei CPU (%)', 'gauge', FALSE, 30);
```

Assign the new profile to each intended Huawei OLT device; the next poll cycle will then use it.

### Inventory / Warehouse

The inventory system tracks spare equipment and materials across multiple physical warehouses. Each warehouse can define granular storage locations using **aisle**, **column**, and **shelf** identifiers. Items move through the system via an immutable transaction log, supporting the full lifecycle from purchase to deployment or sale.

#### Tables Overview

| Table | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| `warehouses` | Physical storage locations (multiple warehouses supported) |
| `inventory_items` | Product catalog — each row is a type of spare part or material |
| `inventory_stock` | Current quantity on hand per item per warehouse location (aisle/column/shelf) |
| `inventory_transactions` | Immutable movement log — every receive, assignment, sale, transfer, return, or adjustment |

#### Transaction Types

| Type | Direction | Description |
|------|-----------|-------------|
| `receive` | Inbound (+) | New stock received from a supplier |
| `assign_to_job` | Outbound (−) | Item used on a field work order (`work_orders`) |
| `sell_to_client` | Outbound (−) | Item sold directly to a client (optionally linked to an invoice) |
| `transfer_out` | Outbound (−) | Item sent to another warehouse location |
| `transfer_in` | Inbound (+) | Item received from another warehouse location |
| `return` | Inbound (+) | Item returned from a job or client |
| `adjustment` | +/− | Manual stock correction (shrinkage, recount, etc.) |

#### Item Categories

`antenna`, `cable`, `router`, `switch`, `onu`, `olt`, `cpe`, `connector`, `power_supply`, `enclosure`, `tool`, `other`

#### Typical Queries

```sql
-- Current stock for all items across all warehouses
SELECT ii.name, w.name AS warehouse, s.aisle, s.col, s.shelf, s.quantity
FROM inventory_stock s
JOIN inventory_items ii ON ii.id = s.item_id
JOIN warehouses w ON w.id = s.warehouse_id
ORDER BY ii.name, w.name;

-- Items below reorder level
SELECT ii.name, ii.reorder_level, SUM(s.quantity) AS total_on_hand
FROM inventory_items ii
JOIN inventory_stock s ON s.item_id = ii.id
WHERE ii.reorder_level IS NOT NULL AND ii.status = 'active'
GROUP BY ii.id
HAVING total_on_hand < ii.reorder_level;

-- All transactions for a specific job
SELECT it.*, ii.name AS item_name
FROM inventory_transactions it
JOIN inventory_stock s ON s.id = it.stock_id
JOIN inventory_items ii ON ii.id = s.item_id
WHERE it.job_id = 42;

-- Revenue from inventory sales in March 2026
SELECT ii.name, SUM(ABS(it.quantity)) AS units_sold,
       SUM(ABS(it.quantity) * it.unit_price) AS revenue
FROM inventory_transactions it
JOIN inventory_stock s ON s.id = it.stock_id
JOIN inventory_items ii ON ii.id = s.item_id
WHERE it.transaction_type = 'sell_to_client'
  AND it.created_at >= '2026-03-01' AND it.created_at < '2026-04-01'
GROUP BY ii.id;
```

## Getting Started (from Source)

Source development requires Node.js 24+ and pnpm 10 (the repository pins the
exact pnpm release through Corepack). The admin frontend uses React 19,
TypeScript, and Vite; the backend exposes the canonical REST API under
`/api/v1/`.

```bash
# 1. Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/vothalvino/vigabss.git
cd vigabss

# 2. Enable the expected package manager
corepack enable
corepack prepare pnpm@10.33.2 --activate

# 3. Install workspace dependencies
pnpm install

# 4. Configure environment
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env — set DB_HOST, DB_USER, DB_PASSWORD, DB_NAME, JWT_SECRET, and ENCRYPTION_KEY

# 5. Set up the database (MySQL 8.0.29+ / MariaDB 10.6+)
pnpm run migrate
pnpm run seed

# 6. Start the backend API
pnpm run dev

# 7. In another terminal, start the frontend
pnpm --filter vigabss-frontend dev
```
