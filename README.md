# FireISP 5.0

Open source ISP management software for customer operations, billing, network management, compliance, and modern self-service/admin workflows.

## Quick Install

Deploy FireISP 5.0 on any Linux server with Docker in a single command:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vothalvino/fireisp5.0/main/install.sh | bash
```

The installer will prompt for your domain name and email, then automatically:

- Clone the repository to `/opt/fireisp`
- Generate strong random passwords and secrets
- Obtain a free TLS certificate via Let's Encrypt
- Build and start all containers (MySQL, Redis, app, Nginx)
- Run database migrations and seed default data

**Prerequisites:** Docker 24+, Docker Compose v2, Git, OpenSSL — all on a server where the domain already resolves.

### Options

Pass variables before the pipe to skip interactive prompts:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vothalvino/fireisp5.0/main/install.sh \
  | DOMAIN=isp.example.com EMAIL=admin@example.com bash
```

| Variable | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `DOMAIN` | *(prompted)* | Public domain name pointing to this server |
| `EMAIL` | *(prompted)* | Admin email — used for Let's Encrypt and first login |
| `INSTALL_DIR` | `/opt/fireisp` | Installation directory |
| `SKIP_TLS` | `0` | Set to `1` to use a self-signed certificate (dev/testing) |
| `CF_API_TOKEN` | — | Cloudflare API token — enables DNS-01 wildcard certificates |
| `DB_PASSWORD` | *(auto-generated)* | MySQL application user password |
| `DB_ROOT_PASSWORD` | *(auto-generated)* | MySQL root password |
| `MYSQL_REPL_PASSWORD` | *(auto-generated)* | MySQL replication password |
| `REDIS_PASSWORD` | *(auto-generated)* | Redis password |
| `JWT_SECRET` | *(auto-generated)* | JWT signing secret (64 chars) |
| `ENCRYPTION_KEY` | *(auto-generated)* | AES-256 key for secrets stored at rest |
| `GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY` | — | Google Maps Geocoding API key — enables resolving a client service address to GPS coordinates (`POST /clients/:id/geocode`). When unset, geocoding returns `503` and coordinates can still be entered manually. |

All generated credentials are saved to `/opt/fireisp/.env.prod` (mode `600`).

> **Full deployment guide:** [`docs/deployment.md`](docs/deployment.md) covers bare-metal, Docker Compose, Kubernetes, TLS setup, MySQL tuning, and a production checklist.
> **FreeRADIUS integration:** [`docs/freeradius/README.md`](docs/freeradius/README.md) covers installing FreeRADIUS 3.x, pointing `rlm_sql` at the FireISP MySQL database, enabling PPPoE/MAB/802.1X/EAP-TLS, and generating `clients.conf` from the `nas` table.

## Database

FireISP 5.0 uses MySQL 8.0+ (or MariaDB 10.6+). The schema is located in the `database/` directory.

### Quick Start

Apply the full schema in one step:

```bash
mysql -u <user> -p <database_name> < database/schema.sql
```

Or apply each migration in order:

```bash
for f in database/migrations/*.sql; do mysql -u <user> -p <database_name> < "$f"; done
```

> **Migration 323–335 — Security & Access Control (§17):** webauthn_credentials, admin_ip_allowlist, password_policies, api_key_rate_limits, firewall_rules, ddos_protection_rules, blackhole_routes, dns_blocklists, cpe_security_scans, encryption_key_metadata, data_masking_rules, secure_deletion_log; plus 4 new roles (super_admin, noc_operator, reseller_admin, auditor) and 36 security module permissions.

> **Migration 336–343 — Automation & Scripting (§18):** automation_rules, automation_rule_executions, batch_jobs, batch_job_items, provisioning_pipelines, provisioning_pipeline_stages, remediation_rules, remediation_executions, automation_scripts, script_executions, router_driver_configs, device_command_executions, analytics_anomalies, churn_scores; plus 30 automation/analytics permissions and 3 scheduled tasks (anomaly_detection, churn_score_computation, remediation_evaluation). Script execution is STUB — no child_process dispatch; sandboxed executor required for live runs.

> **Migration 344–347 — Multi-Tenancy / Reseller Support (§19):** resellers (self-referencing hierarchy up to 2 levels deep, white-label branding, commission_rate), reseller_plan_prices (custom pricing overrides per reseller+plan), reseller_commissions (per-invoice earnings with approve/pay workflow), reseller_ip_pool_allocations, reseller_bandwidth_quotas, reseller_olt_port_assignments, reseller_billing_entities; plus `reseller_id` FK on clients table for reseller scoping. Includes 22 permissions across resellers, reseller_plan_prices, reseller_commissions, reseller_*_allocations/quotas/assignments, reseller_billing_entities, and reseller_portal modules, granted to admin, reseller_admin, and super_admin roles.

> **Migration 348–350 — APIs & Integrations (§20):** integration_providers (27-provider catalog seeded idempotently), integration_connections (per-org instances with AES-256-GCM encrypted credentials), integration_sync_logs (execution records). 8 permissions (integration_providers.view, integration_connections.view/create/update/delete/test/sync, integration_sync_logs.view) granted to admin and super_admin. Routes at /api/v1/integrations (10 endpoints). testConnection() and sync() are STUB — no live HTTP; credentials encrypted at rest and never returned in API responses.

> **Migration 351 — §21.2 AI Support:** Adds `support_conversations` and `support_messages` tables for multi-channel AI customer support conversations.

> **Migration 352 — §21.4 Diagnostics:** Adds `ai_diagnostic_runs` for recording diagnostic engine results.

> **Migration 353 — §21.8 Knowledge Base:** Adds `kb_articles`, `kb_article_embeddings`, and `kb_feedback` for the RAG knowledge base.

> **Migration 354 — §21.6/21.10:** Adds `support_channel_configs` and `ai_support_metrics` for channel configuration and nightly KPI rollup.

> **Migration 355 — §21.11 NOC AI:** Adds `noc_ai_insights` table for AI-generated Network Operations Center insights.

> **Migration 356 — §21 Permissions:** Seeds 14 support/NOC AI permissions and grants them to admin and super_admin roles.

> **Migration 357 — §21 Channel Defaults:** No-op; channel configs created lazily per org on first use.

> **Migration 358 — §21 Scheduled Task:** Seeds the `ai_support_metrics_rollup` task (nightly at 01:00, task_type=other).

> **Migration 369 — Org-level currency:** Adds `currency CHAR(3) NOT NULL DEFAULT 'MXN'` to `organizations` (AFTER country). Each org now has one authoritative ISO 4217 currency; plan create defaults to it when no currency is supplied; Inventory UI reads it dynamically.

> **Migration 371 — NAS access mode:** Adds `access_mode ENUM('direct','nated') NOT NULL DEFAULT 'direct'` to `nas`. In `direct` mode (default) the NAS has a routable IP and FireISP connects to it directly. In `nated` mode the device is behind NAT and FireISP reaches it exclusively over its WireGuard tunnel; `ip_address` is set to the allocated WG tunnel address at create time so RADIUS, health-checks, and the RouterOS API all use the tunnel uniformly.

> **Migration 165–173 table count note:** See migrations 241–246 below for the §5 Dual Stack tables. See migrations 249–263 for §6.1–6.6 SNMP & NMS tables.

> **Migration 241 — DHCP Server Integration (§5.1):** `241_create_dhcp_integration.sql` creates `dhcp_servers` (DHCP server registry supporting ISC Kea and MikroTik) and `dhcp_static_reservations` (MAC-to-IP bindings with DHCP Option 82 circuit/remote-id for subscriber identification). Foreign keys to `ip_pools`, `clients`, and `contracts` allow reservations to be linked to ISP provisioning data.

> **Migration 242 — NAT/CGNAT and PTR Records (§5.1):** `242_create_nat_ptr_management.sql` creates `nat_pools` (CGNAT/1:1 NAT/PAT pool definitions with external IP ranges and per-subscriber port limits) and `ptr_records` (reverse DNS PTR record management for both IPv4 and IPv6 with configurable TTL and zone).

> **Migration 243 — IPv6 Management Enhancements (§5.2):** `243_ipv6_management_enhancements.sql` adds 7 columns to `ip_pools` (DHCPv6 mode, Router Advertisement flags and lifetime, SLAAC prefix, region name) and `stack_type` to `plans` via stored-procedure guards. Creates `ra_guard_policies` table for per-port RA Guard policy management linked to devices.

> **Migration 244 — Dual-Stack Session Management (§5.3):** `244_dual_stack_session_management.sql` adds IPv6CP/DHCPv6-PD fields to `pppoe_service_profiles` (ipv6cp_enabled, delegated_prefix_len, DNS64), IPv6 RADIUS attributes to `radius` (Framed-IPv6-Address, Delegated-IPv6-Prefix, Framed-IPv6-Pool), and per-session IPv6 accounting fields to `connection_logs` (framed_ipv6_prefix, IPv6 octet counters, stack_type). All via stored-procedure guards; `connection_logs` uses no FK (partitioned table).

> **Migration 245 — IPv6 Transition Mechanisms (§5.4):** `245_create_transition_mechanisms.sql` creates four tables: `tunnel_6rd_configs` (6rd Border Relay + IPv6 prefix), `ds_lite_configs` (DS-Lite AFTR address), `map_rules` (MAP-E/MAP-T rule definitions with EA-bits), and `xlat464_configs` (464XLAT PLAT/CLAT/DNS64 prefixes). Together these support the four major IPv4-to-IPv6 transition mechanisms.

> **Migration 246 — Dual-Stack Permissions Seed (§5):** `246_seed_dual_stack_permissions.sql` seeds 25 permissions (`dhcp_servers.*`, `dhcp_reservations.*`, `nat_pools.*`, `ptr_records.*`, `ra_guard.*`, `transition_mechanisms.*`, `ipv6.management`) and assigns them to roles: admin (all 25), technician (all view permissions + ipv6.management), readonly (view permissions only).

> **Migrations 247–248 — Partition maintenance repair:** `247_repair_scheduled_tasks_seeds.sql` deduplicates and repairs ENUM-corrupted `scheduled_tasks` rows from prior seed migrations. `248_automate_partition_capacity_maintenance.sql` fixes `snmp_maintain_partitions()` and `connection_logs_maintain_partitions()` to start from the current month (not next month), and immediately materializes partitions for the current month through +3 months.

> **Migration 249 — Device Groups (§6.1):** `249_create_device_groups.sql` creates `device_groups` (org-scoped logical grouping by type/location/region/OLT/custom) and `device_group_members` junction table. Enables technicians to organize network devices for bulk operations and filtered monitoring views.

> **Migration 250 — SNMPv3 and Discovery (§6.1):** `250_snmpv3_and_discovery.sql` adds 8 SNMPv3 columns to `devices` (security name, auth/priv protocols, encrypted credentials, context name, last_polled_at, last_poll_error) via INFORMATION_SCHEMA-guarded procedures. Creates `discovery_scans` (CIDR-based network scan jobs with full SNMPv3 credential support) and `discovery_results` (per-host scan outcomes with auto-matched profile suggestions and onboarding status tracking).

New services: `pppoeDiagnosticsService` with `classifyAuthFailures()` (org-scoped radpostauth query, reason classification: bad_password/unknown_user/session_limit/no_pool/other), `detectMtuIssues()` (profile MTU > 1492 advisory + heuristic LCP-failure/MTU-mismatch advisory), `scanAuthFailures()` (scheduler handler, emits `pppoe.auth_failures` events). `syncFreeradiusTables()` extended: loads active service profiles per org, determines effective profile per subscriber (account-level `service_profile_id` overrides pool-level), emits `Framed-MTU`, `MS-Primary-DNS-Server`, `MS-Secondary-DNS-Server`, `Session-Timeout`, `Idle-Timeout`, `Filter-Id`, `Mikrotik-Address-List`, and `Mikrotik-Rate-Limit` radreply rows. RouterOS log line parser `parseRouterOsLogLine()` handles PADI/PADS/LCP/IPCP/AUTH/PADT patterns. New API endpoints: full CRUD under `/pppoe-service-profiles` + restore; `GET /pppoe/diagnostics/auth-failures`, `GET /pppoe/diagnostics/mtu-issues`, `GET /pppoe/events` (JWT auth); `POST /pppoe/events` (M2M secret auth via `X-Pppoe-Secret` header or `Authorization: Bearer`). Env vars: `PPPOE_EVENTS_SECRET` (M2M secret, falls back to `RADIUS_ACCOUNTING_SECRET`).

> **Migrations 235–236 — §4.1 PPPoE Management Phase A (Pool Enhancements, Permissions):**
> `235_ip_pools_pppoe_enhancements.sql` adds five guarded columns to `ip_pools`: `nas_id` (FK→nas, for NAS-pool binding), `service_type` ENUM, `default_prefix_len` (IPv6 PD), `excluded_ranges` TEXT, and `last_alerted_threshold` TINYINT (utilization crossing tracker). `236_seed_pppoe_management_permissions.sql` seeds five RBAC permissions (`ip_pools.assign`, `ip_pools.utilization`, `ip_pools.binding_report`, `connection_logs.summary`, `radius.batch_disconnect`) with role assignments, and registers the `check_pool_utilization` hourly scheduled task.

> **Migrations 230–234 — §3.3+§3.4 RADIUS/AAA Phase C (Accounting, CoA hardening, NAS health):**
> `230_radius_accounting_ingest_columns.sql` adds 6 columns to `connection_logs` via stored-procedure guards (partitioned table): `acct_session_id` (Acct-Session-Id), `nas_port_id`, `called_station_id`, `calling_station_id`, `framed_ip`, `framed_ipv6_prefix`; adds index on `acct_session_id`. `231_create_mac_move_events.sql` adds `mac_move_events` table (no FK constraints — loose refs for compliance). `232_nas_registry_enhancements.sql` adds `coa_port`, `location`, `site_id` (FK→sites SET NULL), `secondary_nas_id` (self-ref FK SET NULL), `health_status`, `last_health_check_at` to `nas`. `233_radius_accounting_retention_setting.sql` seeds `purge_radius_accounting` (daily 03:00) and `nas_health_check` (*/5 * * * *) scheduled tasks. `234_seed_radius_accounting_permissions.sql` seeds `radius.accounting_ingest`, `radius.cdr_export`, `radius.coa`, `radius.mac_move_events.view`, `nas.health` RBAC permissions.
> New services: `radiusAccountingService` (ingest Start/Stop/Interim-Update into connection_logs with Gigawords wraparound handling, MAC move detection + synthesised stop rows, CDR export JSON/CSV, retention purge); `radiusCoaEncoder` (RFC 2865 byte-level encoding for User-Name, Framed-IP-Address, VSA type 26 — MikroTik vendor 14988 attrs 8+19, Cisco vendor 9 attr 1); `nasHealthService` (RADIUS Status-Server code 12 probes with Message-Authenticator, up/down transition events). `suspensionService.sendRadiusPacket` upgraded: extra attributes via `encodeNamedAttributes`, secondary NAS failover when primary `sent=false`. New endpoints: `POST /radius/accounting` (machine-to-machine, `RADIUS_ACCOUNTING_SECRET` header auth); `GET /radius/cdr` (audit-logged CDR export with `?from=&to=&username=&format=csv|json`); `POST /radius/coa` (dynamic per-subscriber CoA with named attributes); `GET /radius/mac-move-events` (paginated MAC move log); `GET/POST /nas/:id/health[-check]`. Frontend: new `/mac-move-events` page; `NasList` updated with health badge, CoA port, location, failover NAS fields. Env vars: `RADIUS_ACCOUNTING_SECRET` (required for ingest), `RADIUS_ACCOUNTING_ORG_ID` (single-org deployments), `RADIUS_ACCOUNTING_RETENTION_MONTHS` (default 12). FreeRADIUS rest module configuration documented in `docs/freeradius/README.md`.

> **Migrations 225–229 — §3.2 RADIUS/AAA Phase B (Authorization Gaps):**
> `225_radius_authorization_plan_columns.sql` adds `session_timeout_seconds`, `idle_timeout_seconds`, `simultaneous_use` (default 1) to `plans`, and `simultaneous_use` (NULL=inherit plan), `vlan_id`, `inner_vlan_id` to `radius`; seeds `kick_duplicate_sessions` scheduled task (every 5 min). `226_create_plan_access_windows.sql` adds the `plan_access_windows` table (day_mask + time window, mirroring `plan_speed_windows`). `227_walled_garden_and_suspension_action.sql` adds `organization_walled_garden_settings` and extends `suspension_rules.action` ENUM with `walled_garden`. `228_create_radius_account_routes.sql` adds `radius_account_routes` for per-account `Framed-Route` injection. `229_seed_radius_authz_permissions.sql` seeds RBAC permissions for `plan_access_windows.*`, `radius_account_routes.*`, `walled_garden.*`, `radius.kick_sessions`. Sync now emits: `Session-Timeout` / `Idle-Timeout` in radgroupreply; `Login-Time` in radgroupcheck from access windows (serialized by `radiusLoginTimeService`); `Simultaneous-Use :=` in radcheck (account override wins); `Tunnel-Type`, `Tunnel-Medium-Type`, `Tunnel-Private-Group-Id` in radreply for VLAN assignment (plus `:1` tag for QinQ); `Mikrotik-Address-List` in radreply for walled subscribers; `Framed-Route +=` per route row. New `walledGardenSuspendContract()` / `walledGardenReconnect()` functions handle CoA + suspension log + immediate re-sync. New `kickDuplicateSessions()` finds over-limit subscribers and disconnects oldest sessions via existing Disconnect-Request path. New API endpoints: `GET/POST /plans/:id/access-windows`, `PUT/DELETE /plans/:id/access-windows/:windowId`; `GET/POST /radius/:id/routes`, `PUT/DELETE /radius/:id/routes/:routeId`; `GET/PUT /radius/walled-garden`; `POST /radius/kick-sessions`. Walled garden NAS-side setup documented in `docs/freeradius/README.md`.

> **Migrations 223–224 — §3.1 RADIUS/AAA Phase A:**
> `223_create_freeradius_standard_tables.sql` adds the five standard FreeRADIUS SQL tables (`radcheck`, `radreply`, `radusergroup`, `radgroupcheck`, `radgroupreply`) required by FreeRADIUS `rlm_sql`; adds `auth_method ENUM('pppoe','mac','dot1x','eap_tls')` to the `radius` table (stored-procedure guard); creates the `subscriber_certificates` table for EAP-TLS certificate metadata; and seeds the `check_certificate_expiry` scheduled task (daily 06:00). `radiusService.syncFreeradiusTables()` materializes these tables from FireISP state — radcheck rows are auth-method-aware (Cleartext-Password for PPPoE/dot1x/EAP-TLS, Auth-Type or MAC-as-password for MAB, TLS-Cert-Serial for EAP-TLS), radgroupreply rows carry vendor speed attributes from `radiusAttributeService`. MAB password mode is configurable via org setting `mab_password_mode`. `224_seed_radius_aaa_permissions.sql` seeds `subscriber_certificates.*` and `radius.sync` RBAC permissions. New endpoints: `POST /radius/sync-freeradius`, full CRUD under `/subscriber-certificates` plus `POST /subscriber-certificates/:id/revoke`, `GET /subscriber-certificates/radius-account/:id`, `GET /subscriber-certificates/client/:id`. FreeRADIUS setup guide in `docs/freeradius/`.

> **Migrations 217–222 — §2.5 (Refund Requests, Disputes, Chargebacks, Billing Adjustments):**
> Adds `refund_requests` table (217) with status lifecycle `requested → under_review → approved/rejected → processed`; RBAC seeds (218); `billing_disputes` + `dispute_evidence` tables (219) with multipart evidence upload reusing the existing upload middleware; dispute RBAC seeds (220); `chargebacks` + `billing_adjustments` tables (221); chargeback/adjustment RBAC seeds (222). `paymentGatewayService.handleWebhookEvent` now auto-creates a chargeback row when a dispute webhook is received. `billingAdjustmentService.record()` is called from refund processing and mirrors each adjustment into `audit_logs`. New events: `refund.requested` (webhook dispatch to billing staff), `refund.processed` (email to client + webhook).

> **Migrations 211–216 — §2.3+§2.4 (Payment Plans, Cash Reconciliation, Soft Suspension, Suspension Exempt):**
> Adds payment plan / installment management (211–212), cash reconciliation sessions (213–214), soft-suspend ENUM + speed columns on suspension_rules (215), and suspension_exempt columns on clients (216).

> **Migrations 204–210 — Billing & Subscription Management Phase B (§2.2B):** `204_create_organization_invoice_settings.sql` adds the `organization_invoice_settings` table for per-org invoice branding (logo URL, header color, footer legal text, payment instructions); `pdfService.generateInvoicePdf` now reads these settings. `205_seed_invoice_settings_permissions.sql` seeds `invoice_settings.view` and `invoice_settings.update`. `206_create_late_fee_tables.sql` adds `late_fee_rules` and `invoice_late_fees` tables and seeds the `apply_late_fees` scheduled task (daily 02:00). `207_seed_late_fee_permissions.sql` seeds `late_fees.view` and `late_fees.manage`. `208_create_payment_reminder_tables.sql` adds `payment_reminder_settings` and `payment_reminder_logs` tables and seeds the `send_payment_reminders` scheduled task (hourly). `209_seed_payment_reminder_permissions.sql` seeds `payment_reminders.view` and `payment_reminders.manage`. `210_seed_tax_report_permissions.sql` seeds `billing.tax_reports`. New endpoints: `GET/PUT /invoice-settings`, `GET/POST/PUT/DELETE /late-fee-rules`, `GET/PUT /payment-reminder-settings`, `GET /billing/tax-reports`, `GET /invoices/:id/receipt`, `GET /payments/:id/receipt`.

> **Migrations 200–203 — Plan billing features (§2.1):** `200_plan_billing_features.sql` adds ten columns to `plans` (`radius_vendor`, `radius_rate_limit_template`, `fup_threshold_gb`, `fup_threshold_percent`, `fup_download_speed_mbps`, `fup_upload_speed_mbps`, `overage_mode`, `overage_price_per_gb`, `trial_days`, `trial_price`) and creates `plan_throttle_logs` for FUP throttle audit; seeds `check_fup_thresholds` (every 15 min) and `convert_expired_trials` (hourly) scheduled tasks. `201_create_plan_speed_windows.sql` adds the `plan_speed_windows` table for time-based speed scheduling and seeds the `apply_speed_windows` task (every 5 min). `202_extend_plan_addons_enum.sql` extends `plan_addons.addon_type` with `voip` and `iptv` values. `203_seed_plan_feature_permissions.sql` seeds `plans.radius_attributes`, `plans.speed_windows`, and `plans.fup_throttle` RBAC permissions with role assignments.

> **Migrations 198–199 — Communication campaigns and DND (§1.4):** `198_create_communication_tables.sql` adds the `communication_campaigns`, `campaign_messages`, and `client_dnd_preferences` tables; adds `campaign_message_id` and `opened_at` columns to `email_logs`; adds `campaign_message_id` to `sms_logs`; and seeds the `campaign_send` scheduled task (`*/5 * * * *`) that processes queued campaign messages. `199_seed_communication_permissions.sql` seeds the `communication` RBAC module permissions (`campaigns.*`, `dnd.view`, `dnd.update`) and assigns them to the default roles.

> **Migrations 196–197 — Interaction tracking (§1.3):** `196_create_interaction_tracking_tables.sql` adds the `client_interactions`, `follow_up_reminders`, `satisfaction_surveys`, and `ticket_escalations` tables and seeds three scheduled tasks: `follow_up_reminders` (notify assignees of due follow-ups, every 15 min), `dispatch_satisfaction_surveys` (auto-send CSAT surveys for resolved tickets, hourly), and `auto_escalate_tickets` (escalate tickets unresolved after 48 h, hourly). `197_seed_interaction_permissions.sql` seeds the `interactions` RBAC module permissions (`interactions.*`, `follow_ups.*`, `surveys.*`, `escalations.*`) and assigns them to the default roles. New endpoints: full CRUD under `/interactions`, `/follow-up-reminders` (plus `GET /follow-up-reminders/due`, `POST /follow-up-reminders/:id/complete`), `/satisfaction-surveys` (plus `GET /satisfaction-surveys/metrics`, `POST /satisfaction-surveys/:id/{send,respond}`), `/escalations` (plus `GET /escalations/candidates`, `POST /escalations/:id/transition`), and the unified timeline at `GET /clients/:id/timeline`. New event-bus events with email/SSE/webhook hooks: `followup.due`, `survey.requested`, `ticket.escalated`.

> **Migrations 193–194 — Customer lifecycle (§1.2):** `193_create_customer_lifecycle_tables.sql` adds the `leads`, `service_orders`, `service_order_tasks`, and `winback_campaigns` tables. `194_seed_lifecycle_permissions.sql` seeds the `lifecycle` RBAC module permissions (`leads.*`, `service_orders.*`, `winback.*`, `lifecycle.view`) and assigns them to the default roles. New endpoints: full CRUD under `/leads` (plus `GET /leads/pipeline`, `POST /leads/:id/convert`), `/service-orders` (plus `POST /service-orders/:id/{approve,provision,activate,cancel}` and `GET/POST/PATCH /service-orders/:id/tasks`), `/winback-campaigns` (plus `GET /winback-campaigns/:id/targets`), and lifecycle analytics under `/lifecycle/churn` and `/lifecycle/at-risk`. Activating a service order emits `service_order.activated`, which sends a welcome email/SMS.

> **Migrations 190–192 — Subscriber profile management (§1.1):** `190_add_profile_fields_to_clients.sql` adds `latitude`, `longitude`, `geocoded_at`, `credit_score`, and `risk_rating` to `clients` and extends `client_type` with `corporate`. `191_create_client_custom_fields_table.sql` adds unlimited per-client key/value custom fields. `192_create_client_groups_table.sql` adds the `client_groups` table (family/account grouping) plus `clients.client_group_id`. New endpoints: `POST /clients/:id/geocode`, `GET/PUT/DELETE /clients/:id/custom-fields`, `GET/POST/DELETE /clients/:id/documents`, `GET /clients/:id/duplicates`, `GET /clients/duplicates/scan`, `POST /clients/:id/merge`, plus full CRUD under `/client-groups`. Geocoding requires `GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY`.

> **Migration 051 — Multi-currency ALTER:** `051_add_currency_to_financial_tables.sql` adds a `currency CHAR(3) NOT NULL DEFAULT 'USD'` column (ISO 4217 currency code) to `invoices`, `payments`, `credit_notes`, `quotes`, `plans`, and `expenses`. This is an ALTER TABLE migration applied after the initial schema creation.

> **Migration 053 — Preflight check procedure:** `053_create_preflight_check_event_scheduler.sql` creates the `preflight_check_event_scheduler()` stored procedure. It does not create a table. Call `CALL preflight_check_event_scheduler();` during deployment to verify the MySQL Event Scheduler is enabled before the application starts.

> **Migration 056 — Tax rate references ALTER:** `056_add_tax_rate_id_to_financial_tables.sql` adds a `tax_rate_id BIGINT UNSIGNED NULL` foreign key column to `invoices`, `quotes`, and `credit_notes`, linking them to the `tax_rates` master table. The existing `tax_rate` DECIMAL column is kept as a snapshot of the rate at document-creation time.

> **Migration 058 — Template FK on email_logs ALTER:** `058_add_template_id_to_email_logs.sql` adds a `template_id BIGINT UNSIGNED NULL` foreign key column to `email_logs`, linking each sent message to the `message_templates` table. The existing `template` VARCHAR column is kept for backward compatibility and free-text template names.

> **Migration 065 — Locale switch ALTER:** `065_add_locale_to_clients_and_organizations.sql` adds `locale ENUM('global','MX') NOT NULL DEFAULT 'global'` to both `clients` and `organizations`. Setting `locale = 'MX'` activates SAT CFDI 4.0 and IFT/CRT compliance requirements at the app layer. Existing clients with a CURP are back-filled to `'MX'`.

> **Migration 069 — SAT catalog seed:** `069_seed_sat_catalogs.sql` populates the six SAT CFDI 4.0 catalog tables (sat_regimen_fiscal, sat_uso_cfdi, sat_forma_pago, sat_metodo_pago, sat_tipo_comprobante, sat_moneda) with official SAT values. Uses `INSERT IGNORE` for idempotent re-runs.

> **Migration 074 — Mexico payment methods ALTER:** `074_add_mexico_payment_methods.sql` extends `payments.payment_method` with `oxxo_pay`, `spei`, `codi`, `convenience_store`, and `digital_wallet`, and adds `sat_forma_pago VARCHAR(2)`, `clabe VARCHAR(18)`, and `bank_name VARCHAR(100)` columns.

> **Migration 078 — MX contract template FK ALTER:** `078_add_mx_template_to_contracts.sql` adds `contract_template_mx_id BIGINT UNSIGNED NULL` to `contracts`, linking each contract to an IFT/CRT-registered Carta de Adhesión template. NULL for global clients.

> **Migration 082 — SAT product/unit catalog seed:** `082_seed_sat_clave_prod_serv_and_unidad.sql` populates the ISP-relevant subset of the SAT `c_ClaveProdServ` (7 codes including `81161700` Internet, `81161500` VoIP, `01010101` No aplica) and `c_ClaveUnidad` (6 codes including `E48` Service unit, `MON` Month, `H87` Piece) catalog tables. Uses `INSERT IGNORE` for idempotent re-runs.

> **Migration 084 — CFDI XML/PDF storage ALTER:** `084_add_xml_pdf_storage_to_cfdi_documents.sql` adds `signed_xml LONGTEXT NULL` (complete timbrado XML from PAC — SAT requires 5-year retention), `xml_file_id BIGINT UNSIGNED NULL` (FK to `files` for archival/object-storage), and `pdf_file_id BIGINT UNSIGNED NULL` (FK to `files` for generated PDF) to `cfdi_documents`.

> **Migration 086 — MX locale backfill for company clients:** `086_backfill_mx_locale_for_company_clients.sql` fixes an incomplete backfill from migration 065 — sets `locale = 'MX'` for clients that have a `client_mx_profiles` row but were left on `locale = 'global'` (company clients without a CURP). Also back-fills organizations with an `organization_mx_profiles` row.

> **Migration 087 — MX locale enforcement triggers:** `087_create_mx_locale_enforcement_triggers.sql` adds BEFORE INSERT / BEFORE UPDATE triggers on all MX-specific tables (`client_mx_profiles`, `organization_mx_profiles`, `cfdi_documents`, `concession_titles`, `contract_templates_mx`, `regulatory_filings`, `ift_statistical_reports`) to enforce that the referenced client or organization has `locale = 'MX'`. Also guards `contracts.contract_template_mx_id` — a non-NULL value requires the contract's client to have `locale = 'MX'`. Raises SQLSTATE '45000' on violation.

> **Migration 088 — Locale downgrade guard triggers:** `088_create_locale_downgrade_guard_triggers.sql` adds BEFORE UPDATE triggers on `clients` and `organizations` to prevent changing `locale` from `'MX'` to `'global'` when MX-dependent records exist (MX profiles, CFDI documents, concession titles, contract templates, regulatory filings, IFT statistical reports). Raises SQLSTATE '45000' on violation.

> **Migration 091 — Factura pública stamping safeguards:** `091_add_factura_publica_stamping_safeguards.sql` adds a stored function and two triggers that enforce business rules at stamp time:
> - **`fn_predominant_forma_pago(p_factura_publica_invoice_id)`** — stored function that calculates the predominant SAT `FormaPago` code for a factura pública by summing `payments.amount` grouped by `sat_forma_pago` across all linked invoices and returning the code with the highest total. Defaults to `'99'` (Por definir) when no payments exist or when two or more codes tie for the highest total. Call this function at stamp time to populate `cfdi_documents.forma_pago`. Business rule (SAT Anexo 20 CFDI 4.0): *"En caso de que el pago se realice utilizando más de una forma de pago, se debe indicar la que represente el monto mayor."*
> - **`trg_factura_publica_invoices_bu`** — BEFORE UPDATE trigger on `factura_publica_invoices` that prevents `status` from being set to `'stamped'` if any invoice linked via `factura_publica_invoice_items` does not have `status = 'paid'`. Raises SQLSTATE '45000'. Business rule: including unpaid invoices in a stamped CFDI forces the ISP to pay taxes on revenue it has not yet collected; if the client cancels or never pays, those taxes cannot be recovered.
> - **`trg_factura_publica_invoice_items_bi`** — BEFORE INSERT trigger on `factura_publica_invoice_items` that rejects linking an invoice whose `status` is not `'paid'`. Raises SQLSTATE '45000'. Enforces the same unpaid-invoice exclusion incrementally at insert time.

> **Migration 092 — Exportacion field ALTER:** `092_add_exportacion_to_cfdi_documents.sql` adds `exportacion ENUM('01','02','03') NOT NULL DEFAULT '01'` to `cfdi_documents`. This is a mandatory SAT CFDI 4.0 attribute on the `<Comprobante>` node: `01` = no export (domestic, most common for ISPs), `02` = definitive export, `03` = temporary export. Omitting it causes PAC rejection.

> **Migration 093 — Complemento de Pago 2.0 tax support:** `093_add_complemento_pago_2_tax_support.sql` adds `objeto_imp_dr ENUM('01','02','03') NOT NULL DEFAULT '02'` to `cfdi_payment_complement_items` (ObjetoImpDR on each DoctoRelacionado) and creates the `cfdi_payment_complement_item_taxes` table for per-document-related tax breakdown (`ImpuestosP`). Required by SAT Complemento de Pago 2.0 when `objeto_imp_dr = '02'`.

> **Migration 094 — CFDI document FK constraints:** `094_add_fks_cfdi_documents_to_sat_catalogs.sql` adds foreign key constraints from `cfdi_documents` to SAT catalog tables: `tipo_comprobante` → `sat_tipo_comprobante`, `uso_cfdi` → `sat_uso_cfdi`, `metodo_pago` → `sat_metodo_pago`, `forma_pago` → `sat_forma_pago`, `moneda` → `sat_moneda`. Prevents invalid SAT codes from being stored.

> **Migration 095 — CFDI conceptos FK constraints:** `095_add_fks_cfdi_conceptos_to_sat_catalogs.sql` adds foreign key constraints from `cfdi_conceptos` to SAT catalog tables: `clave_prod_serv` → `sat_clave_prod_serv`, `clave_unidad` → `sat_clave_unidad`. Prevents invalid SAT product/service and unit codes on CFDI line items.

> **Migration 096 — SAT catalog seed expansion:** `096_seed_missing_sat_catalog_entries.sql` adds missing `sat_regimen_fiscal` codes (`607` Enajenación o Adquisición de Bienes, `609` Consolidación, `611` Ingresos por Dividendos, `615` Ingresos por obtención de premios) and `sat_uso_cfdi` codes (`D05`–`D10`: medical insurance premiums, school transportation, savings plan deposits, tuition, voluntary SAR contributions, major medical insurance premiums). Uses `INSERT IGNORE` for idempotent re-runs.

> **Migration 097 — Facturar guard triggers:** `097_add_facturar_guard_triggers.sql` adds BEFORE INSERT / BEFORE UPDATE triggers on `contracts` that raise SQLSTATE '45000' when `facturar = TRUE` and the client's `locale != 'MX'`. Prevents non-MX clients from being assigned to the Mexican e-invoicing workflow.

> **Migration 098 — Country default NULL:** `098_set_country_default_null.sql` changes the DEFAULT for `clients.country` and `organizations.country` from `'US'` to `NULL`. Existing rows are not modified — only future inserts without an explicit country value will receive `NULL` instead of `'US'`.

> **Migration 099 — Fix XXX currency description:** `099_fix_xxx_currency_description.sql` updates `sat_moneda` to set the `XXX` currency description to the official SAT text: *"Los códigos asignados para las transacciones en que no intervenga ninguna moneda"* (previously incorrectly set to *"Los derechos en esta divisa"*).

> **Migration 100 — CSD expiry monitoring task:** `100_seed_csd_expiry_scheduled_task.sql` inserts a system-level scheduled task (`csd_expiry_monitor`, cron `0 8 * * *`) that checks `organization_mx_profiles.csd_valid_to` for certificates expiring within 30 days and generates email + in-app notifications. Uses `INSERT IGNORE` for idempotent re-runs. If a CSD expires, the ISP cannot stamp any new CFDIs.

> **Migration 101 — Payment gateways:** `101_create_payment_gateways_table.sql` creates the `payment_gateways` table for per-organization payment provider configuration (Stripe, Conekta, OpenPay, MercadoPago, PayPal, manual, other). Stores environment (sandbox/production), encrypted secret key, optional public key, webhook signing secret, default flag, and a JSON column for provider-specific settings.

> **Migration 102 — Payment transactions:** `102_create_payment_transactions_table.sql` creates the `payment_transactions` table — a raw gateway transaction log for every payment attempt. Records the provider's reference ID, gateway status (pending/succeeded/failed/refunded/disputed/cancelled), raw request/response JSON, webhook payload, and a unique idempotency key to prevent duplicate charges.

> **Migration 103 — Recurring payment profiles:** `103_create_recurring_payment_profiles_table.sql` creates the `recurring_payment_profiles` table for stored card tokens per client (autopay). Holds the gateway's customer or card token, card brand, last four digits, expiry month/year, default flag, and lifecycle status (active/expired/revoked).

> **Migration 104 — Suspension rules:** `104_create_suspension_rules_table.sql` creates the `suspension_rules` table for configurable auto-suspend/disconnect rules per organization. Each rule specifies a days-past-due threshold, grace period, action (auto_suspend/notify_only/auto_disconnect), optional advance notification window, and optional plan-ID scoping via JSON.

> **Migration 105 — Suspension logs:** `105_create_suspension_logs_table.sql` creates the `suspension_logs` table — a full audit trail of suspend/unsuspend/disconnect/reconnect events per contract. Records the triggering rule (NULL for manual actions), performer, RADIUS CoA sent/response, linked invoice, and suspend/restore timestamps.

> **Migration 106 — CSD certificates:** `106_create_csd_certificates_table.sql` creates the `csd_certificates` table for storing CSD `.cer`/`.key` files per organization. Holds PEM-encoded public certificate, application-encrypted private key, optional encrypted passphrase, SHA-256 fingerprint (unique), certificate number (NoCertificado, unique), RFC, validity window, and active/expired/revoked status. The `valid_to` column is used by the CSD expiry monitor task (migration 100).

> **Migration 107 — PAC providers:** `107_create_pac_providers_table.sql` creates the `pac_providers` table for PAC (Proveedor Autorizado de Certificación) credentials and endpoint configuration. Supports Finkok, SW Sapien, Digicel, Comercio Digital, FacturAPI with sandbox/production environments. Unique constraint on `(organization_id, provider_name, environment)`.

> **Migration 108 — Webhooks:** `108_create_webhooks_table.sql` creates the `webhooks` table for outbound webhook registrations per organization. Each record defines a target URL, encrypted HMAC signing secret, JSON array of subscribed event names, max retries (default 5), and timeout (default 30s).

> **Migration 109 — Webhook deliveries:** `109_create_webhook_deliveries_table.sql` creates the `webhook_deliveries` table — a per-attempt delivery log for outbound webhooks. Records HTTP status code, response body, response time, attempt number, delivery status (pending/success/failed/retrying), and next retry timestamp.

> **Migration 110 — Organization users:** `110_create_organization_users_table.sql` creates the `organization_users` pivot table linking users to organizations with per-organization roles (owner/admin/manager/technician/billing/readonly). Unique on `(organization_id, user_id)`. Enables multi-tenant user membership where one user account can belong to multiple organizations.

> **Migration 111 — Plan add-ons:** `111_create_plan_addons_table.sql` creates the `plan_addons` catalog table for upsellable add-ons per organization — static IP, extra IP block, extra bandwidth, equipment rental, or other. Stores price, billing cycle (monthly/one-time/yearly), taxability flag, and availability status.

> **Migration 112 — Contract add-ons:** `112_create_contract_addons_table.sql` creates the `contract_addons` table for add-ons attached to a specific client contract. References the plan_addons catalog and stores contracted quantity, negotiated unit price, start/end dates, and lifecycle status (active/cancelled/expired).

> **Migration 113 — Speed tests:** `113_create_speed_tests_table.sql` creates the `speed_tests` table for recording speed test results from multiple sources (client_portal/technician/automated_probe/external). Stores download/upload Mbps, latency, jitter, packet loss, observed IP address, and tested-at timestamp. Optional FKs to clients, contracts, and devices.

> **Migration 114 — Ticket SLA events:** `114_create_ticket_sla_events_table.sql` creates the `ticket_sla_events` table for SLA tracking per support ticket. Records milestones (first_response/resolution/escalation/breach_warning/breach), target deadline, actual timestamp, breach flag, and minutes past deadline. FK to `sla_definitions` (migration 063).

> **Migration 115 — SMS logs:** `115_create_sms_logs_table.sql` creates the `sms_logs` table for SMS and WhatsApp notification logging per organization. Complements `email_logs` for non-email channels. Captures direction (outbound/inbound), provider name, provider message ID, delivery status, error details, per-message cost, and send/delivery timestamps. FK to `message_templates`.

> **Migration 116 — Revenue summary:** `116_create_revenue_summary_table.sql` creates the `revenue_summary` materialized table for MRR/churn/ARPU reporting — populated by a scheduled task, not a SQL VIEW. One row per organization per calendar month per currency. Stores MRR, active clients/contracts, new/churned contracts, ARPU, total revenue/collected/outstanding.

> **Migration 117 — Network health snapshots:** `117_create_network_health_snapshots_table.sql` creates the `network_health_snapshots` table for aggregated daily device and link health data. Stores uptime %, avg/max latency, avg/peak throughput in/out, packet loss, and total downtime minutes. Composite indexes on `(device_id, snapshot_date)` and `(network_link_id, snapshot_date)`.

> **Migration 118 — CFDI cancellations:** `118_create_cfdi_cancellations_table.sql` creates the `cfdi_cancellations` table — a SAT CFDI cancellation audit trail. Records the cancellation reason code (motivo: 01=con relación, 02=sin relación, 03=no se llevó a cabo, 04=nominativa en CFDI global), optional replacement UUID (folio_sustitucion, required for motivo 01), PAC response status, raw acuse XML, and requesting user. FK to `cfdi_documents`, `pac_providers`, and `users`.

> **Migration 119 — Seed default roles and permissions:** `119_seed_default_roles_and_permissions.sql` inserts the five built-in system roles (`admin`, `billing`, `support`, `technician`, `readonly`) with `is_system = TRUE` so they cannot be deleted. Also inserts all granular permission slugs (e.g. `clients.view`, `invoices.create`, `devices.delete`, `audit_logs.view`) grouped by module, and the `role_permissions` mappings: `admin` gets all permissions; `billing` gets billing/financial access; `support` gets client/ticket access; `technician` gets device/job/inventory access; `readonly` gets all `*.view` and `*.export` permissions. Uses `INSERT IGNORE` for idempotent re-runs.

> **Migration 120 — Seed default settings:** `120_seed_default_settings.sql` populates the `settings` key-value table with 25 default values covering currency (`default_currency = USD`), invoice/quote/credit-note prefixes, SMTP configuration, SNMP polling interval and community, company profile fields, locale/date-format/pagination preferences, session and login security parameters, and automation flags (`auto_suspend_enabled`, `auto_invoice_enabled`). Uses `INSERT IGNORE` — administrator-customised values are never overwritten on re-runs.

> **Migration 121 — Seed default tax rates:** `121_seed_default_tax_rates.sql` inserts four globally applicable default tax rates (`organization_id = NULL`): Tax Exempt (0%), Standard Tax 8%, IVA 16% (Mexico), and GST 5% (Canada). Uses `WHERE NOT EXISTS` guards for full idempotency since the `tax_rates` table does not carry a `UNIQUE` constraint on `name` alone.

> **Migration 122 — Seed default suspension rule:** `122_seed_default_suspension_rule.sql` inserts a default auto-suspend rule into `suspension_rules` for the first organization (id = 1): 30 days past due, 5-day grace period, action `auto_suspend`. Uses `WHERE NOT EXISTS` to be idempotent. Because `suspension_rules.organization_id` is `NOT NULL`, this seed targets org id = 1; administrators should add per-organization rules as part of tenant onboarding.

> **Migration 123 — Seed scheduled tasks for core automation:** `123_seed_scheduled_tasks_core_automation.sql` inserts the five system-level automation tasks that drive FireISP's main operational loops: `auto_generate_invoices` (daily at 01:00), `auto_suspend_overdue` (daily at 06:00), `radius_sync` (every 5 min), `populate_revenue_summary` (monthly on the 1st at 02:00), and `populate_network_health_snapshots` (daily at 04:00). All tasks use `organization_id = NULL` (global) and `is_enabled = TRUE`. Uses `INSERT IGNORE` on the `UNIQUE KEY (organization_id, task_name)`.

> **Migration 124 — Add currency to expenses (idempotent guard):** `124_add_currency_to_expenses.sql` adds `expenses.currency CHAR(3) NOT NULL DEFAULT 'USD'` after the `amount` column for multi-currency expense tracking. The migration is wrapped in a stored-procedure guard that checks `INFORMATION_SCHEMA.COLUMNS` before issuing the `ALTER TABLE`, making it a safe no-op on installations where migration 051 already applied the same column.

> **Migration 125 — Add tax_rate_id to line-item tables:** `125_add_tax_rate_id_to_line_item_tables.sql` adds a `tax_rate_id BIGINT UNSIGNED NULL` foreign-key column to `invoice_items`, `quote_items`, and `credit_note_items`. `NULL` means "inherit the rate from the parent document". This enables per-line-item tax rates for mixed-rate invoices common in multi-tax-rate jurisdictions (e.g. different rates for hardware vs. services). `ON DELETE SET NULL` prevents cascading deletes when a `tax_rates` row is removed.

> **Migration 126 — Payment allocation balance guard triggers:** `126_payment_allocation_balance_guard_triggers.sql` adds four `BEFORE INSERT / BEFORE UPDATE` triggers on `payment_allocations` that enforce two financial integrity rules at the database level: (1) the total allocated amount for a payment cannot exceed `payments.amount`, and (2) the total allocated amount for an invoice cannot exceed `invoices.total`. Both violations raise `SQLSTATE '45000'` with descriptive messages. Uses `DROP TRIGGER IF EXISTS` before each `CREATE TRIGGER` for safe re-runs.

> **Migration 127 — Inventory stock negative guard trigger:** `127_inventory_stock_negative_guard_trigger.sql` adds a `BEFORE UPDATE` trigger on `inventory_stock` that raises `SQLSTATE '45000'` when a stock update would set `quantity < 0`. This prevents physically impossible inventory state from silently corrupting reports and downstream job fulfillment. Uses `DROP TRIGGER IF EXISTS` for safe re-runs.

> **Migration 128 — PPPoE contract RADIUS consistency trigger:** `128_connection_type_radius_consistency_trigger.sql` adds a `BEFORE UPDATE` trigger on `contracts` that raises `SQLSTATE '45000'` when a contract with `connection_type IN ('pppoe', 'pppoe_dual')` is activated (`status` changed to `'active'`) without at least one corresponding `radius` row. Contracts start in `pending` status so RADIUS accounts can be provisioned before activation; the guard fires only at activation time. Uses `DROP TRIGGER IF EXISTS` for safe re-runs.

> **Migration 129 — Composite indexes for query performance:** `129_add_composite_indexes_for_query_performance.sql` adds five composite indexes for common multi-column query patterns: `idx_invoices_currency_status ON invoices(currency, status)`, `idx_payment_transactions_gateway_id_status ON payment_transactions(payment_gateway_id, gateway_status)`, `idx_expenses_currency ON expenses(currency)`, `idx_contracts_client_facturar ON contracts(client_id, facturar)`, and `idx_suspension_logs_contract_created ON suspension_logs(contract_id, created_at)`. Each index is guarded via `INFORMATION_SCHEMA.STATISTICS` in a stored procedure for safe re-runs. Note: `webhook_deliveries.next_retry_at` already has a single-column index from migration 109.

> **Migration 130 — FireRelay nodes:** `130_create_firerelay_nodes_table.sql` creates the `firerelay_nodes` table — a registry of all nodes in a FireRelay cluster. Only used when `FIRERELAY_MODE = master`. Tracks node ID, API URL, status (active/draining/maintenance/offline), resource metrics (CPU %, memory %, disk %, DB size), client and device counts, uptime, and last-seen heartbeat.

> **Migration 131 — FireRelay client routing:** `131_create_firerelay_client_routing_table.sql` creates the `firerelay_client_routing` table — maps each `client_id` to the FireRelay node that owns it. Only used when `FIRERELAY_MODE = master`. Foreign key to `firerelay_nodes` with `ON DELETE RESTRICT`.

> **Migration 132 — Webhook events:** `132_create_webhook_events_table.sql` creates the `webhook_events` table for inbound payment gateway webhook events. Stores raw JSON payloads from Stripe, Conekta, and other providers with deduplication via unique `(provider, provider_event_id)` constraint. Tracks processing status (received/processing/processed/failed/ignored) and links to `payment_transactions` after reconciliation.

> **Migration 133 — Idempotency keys:** `133_create_idempotency_keys_table.sql` creates the `idempotency_keys` table for preventing duplicate payment charges. Stores client-supplied unique keys scoped per organization with cached HTTP response codes and bodies. Keys expire after 24 hours and are cleaned up by a scheduled task.

> **Migration 134 — Alert rules:** `134_create_alert_rules_table.sql` creates the `alert_rules` table for configurable monitoring alert rules per organization. Each rule defines a metric (cpu_usage, memory_usage, signal_strength, latency_ms, packet_loss, uptime), comparison operator, threshold, evaluation window in minutes, severity (info/warning/major/critical), optional auto-outage creation flag, and notification channels (email/SMS/SSE/webhook as JSON array).

> **Migration 135 — Alert events:** `135_create_alert_events_table.sql` creates the `alert_events` table — a log of triggered alert events. Records the firing alert rule, device, current vs threshold values, and lifecycle status (triggered/acknowledged/resolved) with acknowledgement and resolution timestamps.

> **Migration 136 — 2FA / TOTP ALTER:** `136_add_totp_to_users.sql` adds `totp_secret VARCHAR(255) NULL`, `totp_enabled BOOLEAN NOT NULL DEFAULT FALSE`, and `totp_backup_codes JSON NULL` to `users` for two-factor authentication support. Uses an idempotent stored procedure guard to skip if columns already exist.

> **Migration 137 — Data cap ALTER:** `137_add_data_cap_to_plans.sql` adds `data_cap_gb DECIMAL(10,2) NULL` to `plans` for monthly data cap in GB (NULL = unlimited). Uses an idempotent stored procedure guard.

> **Migration 138 — Seed alert evaluation task:** `138_seed_alert_evaluation_task.sql` inserts the `alert_evaluation` scheduled task (cron `*/5 * * * *`) that evaluates monitoring alert rules against current SNMP metrics every 5 minutes.

> **Migration 139 — Seed recurring charge task:** `139_seed_recurring_charge_task.sql` inserts the `process_recurring_charges` scheduled task (cron `0 7 * * *`) that auto-charges active recurring payment profiles with pending invoices daily at 07:00.

> **Migration 140 — Login lockout ALTER:** `140_add_login_lockout_to_users.sql` adds `failed_login_attempts TINYINT UNSIGNED NOT NULL DEFAULT 0` and `locked_until TIMESTAMP NULL` to `users` for brute-force account lockout protection.

> **Migration 141 — Composite indexes (batch 2):** `141_add_composite_indexes.sql` adds ten composite indexes for high-traffic query patterns: `idx_invoices_client_created`, `idx_invoices_status_due`, `idx_payments_contract_date`, `idx_payments_client_created`, `idx_connection_logs_contract_start`, `idx_tickets_client_status`, `idx_tickets_assigned_status`, `idx_webhook_deliveries_status_created`, `idx_audit_logs_entity_type_id`, and `idx_contracts_client_status`.

> **Migration 142 — Webhook dead letter ALTER:** `142_add_webhook_dead_letter.sql` adds `dead_letter` to the `webhook_deliveries.status` ENUM for deliveries that have exhausted all retry attempts. Adds `idx_webhook_deliveries_dead_letter` index for dead-letter dashboard queries.

> **Migration 143 — Optimistic locking ALTER:** `143_add_version_columns.sql` adds `version INT UNSIGNED NOT NULL DEFAULT 1` to `invoices`, `contracts`, `payments`, and `clients` for optimistic concurrency control.

> **Migration 144 — Billing period uniqueness:** `144_add_billing_period_unique_constraint.sql` adds a unique composite index `uq_billing_period_contract_dates (contract_id, period_start, period_end)` to `billing_periods` to prevent duplicate invoices for the same contract and billing period.

> **Migration 145 — Seed data retention task:** `145_seed_data_retention_task.sql` inserts the `data_retention` scheduled task (cron `0 3 * * *`) that purges old audit logs, alert events, webhook deliveries, and expired idempotency keys daily at 03:00.

> **Migration 146 — Credit note invoice cap triggers:** `146_credit_note_invoice_total_guard_trigger.sql` adds BEFORE INSERT / BEFORE UPDATE triggers on `credit_notes` that prevent the sum of credit note totals (excluding cancelled) from exceeding the linked invoice total. Raises SQLSTATE '45000' on over-credit.

> **Migration 147 — Audit log immutability triggers:** `147_audit_log_immutability_triggers.sql` adds BEFORE UPDATE / BEFORE DELETE triggers on `audit_logs` that block any modification or removal of audit records. Audit logs are append-only for compliance; the data-retention service uses administrative privileges to bypass when needed. Raises SQLSTATE '45000'.

> **Migration 148 — CFDI document immutability trigger:** `148_cfdi_document_immutability_trigger.sql` adds a BEFORE UPDATE trigger on `cfdi_documents` that prevents modification of stamped (`sat_status = 'vigente'`) documents' financial fields (subtotal, total, UUID, XML, receptor data, etc.) per SAT Anexo 20. Only `sat_status` changes (for the cancellation flow) and non-financial metadata (pdf_url, updated_at) remain modifiable. Raises SQLSTATE '45000'.

> **Migration 149 — Contract status FSM trigger:** `149_contract_status_fsm_trigger.sql` adds a BEFORE UPDATE trigger on `contracts` that enforces valid status transitions: `pending → active|cancelled`, `active → expired|cancelled`. Both `expired` and `cancelled` are terminal states. Raises SQLSTATE '45000' on invalid transitions.

> **Migration 150 — Outage temporal logic triggers:** `150_outage_temporal_logic_trigger.sql` adds BEFORE INSERT / BEFORE UPDATE triggers on `outages` that ensure `resolved_at` is always after `started_at` when set. Prevents nonsensical duration calculations and corrupt SLA/uptime reporting. Raises SQLSTATE '45000'.

> **Migration 151 — Soft-delete columns:** `151_add_soft_delete_columns.sql` adds a nullable `deleted_at DATETIME` column and a corresponding index to 62 resource tables (users, clients, contracts, invoices, payments, devices, tickets, and all other major entities). Enables archive-on-delete instead of hard `DELETE`, preserving data integrity and audit trails. The `BaseModel.delete()` method sets `deleted_at = NOW()` while `forceDelete()` performs a hard delete; `restore()` clears the column.

> **Migration 152 — Refresh token rotation:** `152_add_refresh_token_rotation.sql` adds a `token_family VARCHAR(255)` column and index to `user_sessions`. The family identifier links all refresh tokens issued from one login session, enabling server-side reuse detection: if an already-rotated token is presented, all sessions in the same family are revoked to mitigate refresh token theft.

> **Migration 153 — Payment retries table:** `153_create_payment_retries_table.sql` creates the `payment_retries` table that tracks failed payment charges and schedules automatic retry attempts. Each row represents a retry schedule for a failed `payment_transactions` record. Retries follow exponential backoff (4 h → 24 h → 72 h, 3 attempts maximum). Stores attempt count, next retry timestamp, last error, status (`pending` / `processing` / `succeeded` / `exhausted` / `cancelled`), and FK links to the original transaction, client, invoice, and recurring payment profile.

> **Migration 154 — Seed payment retry task:** `154_seed_payment_retry_task.sql` inserts the `retry_failed_charges` scheduled task (cron `0 * * * *` — hourly) that processes pending payment retries whose `next_retry_at` has passed. Uses `INSERT IGNORE` for idempotency.

> **Migration 155 — Seed billing cycle task:** `155_seed_billing_cycle_task.sql` inserts the `billing_cycle` scheduled task (cron `0 2 * * *` — daily at 02:00, priority `high`, timeout 600 s) that orchestrates the full automated revenue engine: auto-generate invoices → email invoice to client → send suspension warning emails for overdue contracts approaching the rule threshold → suspend contracts past the `days_past_due` limit and email post-suspension confirmation. Dispatched by `taskRunner.runBillingCycle()`. Uses `INSERT IGNORE` for idempotency.

> **Migration 156 — Seed database backup task:** `156_seed_database_backup_task.sql` inserts the `database_backup` scheduled task (cron `0 3 * * *` — daily at 03:00 UTC, priority `normal`, timeout 1800 s, 2 retries) that runs `mysqldump`, compresses the output with gzip, saves it locally in `storage/backups/` (retaining the last 7 copies), and uploads it to S3-compatible cloud storage (AWS S3 or Backblaze B2) when `BACKUP_S3_BUCKET`/`BACKUP_S3_REGION`/`BACKUP_S3_ACCESS_KEY`/`BACKUP_S3_SECRET_KEY` are configured. Cloud upload failure is non-fatal — the local copy is retained. Uses `INSERT IGNORE` for idempotency.

> **Migration 157 — IFT statistical report alignment ALTER:** `157_align_ift_statistical_reports_with_ift_format.sql` aligns `ift_statistical_reports` with the IFT *Formato Estadístico — Servicio Fijo de Internet* required fields (see [`docs/ift-statistical-report-schema-review.md`](docs/ift-statistical-report-schema-review.md)). Adds `concession_title_id BIGINT UNSIGNED NULL` (FK to `concession_titles`, IFT F2), `subscribers_by_municipality JSON NULL` (INEGI municipality-code breakdown, IFT F5), `subscribers_by_customer_type JSON NULL` (residential/business counts, IFT F11), `subscribers_by_payment_modality JSON NULL` (pospago/prepago/empaquetado counts, IFT F12), and `notes TEXT NULL` (free-form filing comments).

> **Migration 158 — FireRelay node on devices + config backup task:** `158_add_firerelay_node_to_devices_and_seed_config_backup_task.sql` adds `firerelay_node_id VARCHAR(64) NULL` to `devices` (with `idx_devices_firerelay_node_id` index) — records which FireRelay agent can reach the device via the RouterOS API. No FK is added because the agent connection is the authoritative reachability source and standalone-mode deployments may have no `firerelay_nodes` rows. Also seeds the `config_backup_pull` scheduled task (cron `0 2 * * *`, daily at 02:00 UTC, 2 retries, 3600 s timeout) that pulls RouterOS `/export` configs from all devices with a `firerelay_node_id` and stores versioned snapshots in `device_config_backups` with SHA-256 deduplication. Uses `INSERT IGNORE` for idempotency.

> **Migration 159 — Auto-create ticket on alert:** `159_add_auto_create_ticket_to_alert_rules.sql` adds `auto_create_ticket BOOLEAN NOT NULL DEFAULT FALSE` to `alert_rules`. When enabled, the alert evaluation task automatically creates a support ticket for each triggered alert event with severity `critical` or `high`. The ticket is linked to the device, client, or site referenced in the alert and pre-populated with the alert threshold breach details.

> **Migration 160 — Portal credentials on clients:** `160_add_portal_credentials_to_clients.sql` adds `portal_email VARCHAR(255) NULL` (UNIQUE, nullable for clients without portal access) and `portal_password_hash VARCHAR(255) NULL` to `clients` for self-service portal authentication. Portal credentials are separate from administrative user credentials; clients can log in with their portal_email to view invoices, submit tickets, run speed tests, and manage payment methods.

> **Migration 161 — Portal refresh tokens table:** `161_create_portal_refresh_tokens_table.sql` creates the `portal_refresh_tokens` table that stores SHA-256 hashed refresh tokens for long-lived client portal authentication. Each row links to a `client_id`, includes an `expires_at` timestamp, and supports revocation via `revoked_at`. Complements the portal credentials added in migration 160; enables "remember me" sessions without exposing long-lived access tokens.

> **Migration 162 — Seed webhook retry task:** `162_seed_webhook_retry_task.sql` inserts the `webhook_retry` scheduled task (cron `*/10 * * * *` — every 10 minutes) that processes pending webhook deliveries whose `next_retry_at` has passed and status is `pending` or `retrying`. Implements exponential backoff (5 min → 15 min → 60 min → 6 h → 24 h, 5 attempts maximum). Uses `INSERT IGNORE` for idempotency.

> **Migration 163 — SNMP traps table:** `163_create_snmp_traps_table.sql` creates the `snmp_traps` table that stores unsolicited SNMP trap messages received from network devices. The trap receiver listens on UDP (port 1620 by default, configurable via `SNMP_TRAP_PORT`). Each row captures the device IP, trap type (coldStart, warmStart, linkDown, linkUp, authenticationFailure, egpNeighborLoss, enterpriseSpecific, unknown), raw OID, timestamp, uptime, variable bindings (varbinds) as JSON, and optional FK link to a known device. Enables automated alerting on device reboots, link failures, and authentication failures. Partitioned by month with 6-month retention.

> **Migration 164 — DR drill logs table + quarterly task:** `164_create_dr_drill_logs.sql` creates the `dr_drill_logs` table to record the outcome of each automated quarterly DR-drill run (Phase 1: backup + size verification, Phase 4: referential-integrity + financial-consistency checks). The drill is NON-DESTRUCTIVE — Phases 2 (drop) and 3 (restore) remain manual per `docs/dr-drill.md`. Also seeds the `quarterly_dr_drill` scheduled task (cron `0 2 1 1,4,7,10 *` — 02:00 on 1 Jan / 1 Apr / 1 Jul / 1 Oct, 1 retry, 3600 s timeout). Drill results (pass/fail/error) and an overdue flag are surfaced in the admin frontend on every login for compliance visibility.

> **Migration 165 — SSO configuration tables (P2.1):** `165_create_sso_configs.sql` creates three tables for per-organization single sign-on:
> - **`organization_sso_configs`** — one row per `(organization_id, provider_type)` (SAML 2.0 or OIDC); holds all IdP connection settings (SAML entity ID / SSO URL / SLO URL / X.509 cert / SP private key; OIDC issuer / client ID / client secret), attribute-mapping JSON, auto-provisioning flag, and the default role assigned to new SSO users. Unique constraint on `(organization_id, provider_type)`.
> - **`organization_sso_group_mappings`** — maps exact IdP group names to FireISP roles; evaluated at login to give authenticated users their correct role. Unique constraint on `(sso_config_id, idp_group)`.
> - **`sso_auth_states`** — short-lived OIDC state/nonce store for the authorization-code flow; rows expire after 10 minutes and should be purged by a cleanup task. Unique constraint on `state`.

> **Migration 166 — Per-tenant resource quotas:** `166_create_organization_quotas.sql` creates the `organization_quotas` table that stores optional upper bounds per organization for four resources: `max_clients` (active client records), `max_devices` (active device records), `max_storage_mb` (sum of all org-owned `files.file_size`), and `max_scheduled_tasks` (org-scoped scheduled task rows). A `NULL` value in any limit column means "unlimited" for that resource. A row is created only when a quota is first configured; the absence of a row is also treated as unlimited. The `checkQuota` middleware enforces these limits at the API layer before the relevant creation handlers. Unique constraint on `organization_id`.

> **Migration 167 — Per-tenant database isolation config:** `167_create_organization_database_configs.sql` creates the `organization_database_configs` control-plane table. One row per organization (unique constraint). Stores `isolation_mode` (`shared` default, `isolated` opt-in), isolated database host, port, name, user, AES-256-GCM-encrypted password (`db_password_encrypted`), SSL flag, and `last_verified_at` timestamp. When `isolation_mode = 'isolated'` and a valid connection config is present, `src/config/database.js` routes every DB operation for that organization to a dedicated MySQL pool (cached in memory, invalidated on config update). Admin endpoints: `GET/PUT /api/v1/organizations/:id/database-isolation` (masked config), `POST /api/v1/organizations/:id/database-isolation/test` (connectivity check + records `last_verified_at`). `FK ON DELETE CASCADE` from `organizations`.

> **Migration 168 — PROFECO complaint tracking:** `168_create_profeco_complaints_table.sql` creates the `profeco_complaints` table for ISPs subject to Mexico's PROFECO (Procuraduría Federal del Consumidor) CONCILIANET obligations. One row per complaint folio. Stores `folio_profeco` (official CONCILIANET folio, nullable until assigned), `consumer_name`, `consumer_email/phone`, `service_type`, `complaint_category`, `description`, `status` (`received` → `in_process` → `resolved` / `escalated`), `resolution_notes`, `received_at`, `response_deadline`, `resolved_at`, `submitted_by` (FK to users), and optional FKs to `clients` and `tickets`. Unique constraint on `(organization_id, folio_profeco)`. Supports quarterly export for regulatory filing.

> **Migration 169 — AI Reply Assistant tables + device/link columns:** `169_ai_assistant.sql` creates six tables for the AI Reply Assistant feature (`ai_policies`, `ai_providers`, `ai_phrase_library`, `ai_forbidden_terms`, `ai_reply_logs`, `contract_topology_paths`) and adds two ALTER TABLE statements: `devices.role ENUM('cpe','pop','backbone','border','access') NULL` for topology classification, and `network_links.medium ENUM('fiber','wireless','copper') NULL` + `network_links.role ENUM('backbone','distribution','access','client') NULL` for link metadata used by `topologyContextService`.

> **Migration 170 — AI cost roll-up columns on organization_quotas:** `170_ai_cost_rollup.sql` adds `max_ai_tokens_month BIGINT UNSIGNED NULL` (monthly token budget; NULL = unlimited), `ai_cost_month_usd DECIMAL(10,4) NOT NULL DEFAULT 0` (running cost accumulator reset monthly by the `aiCostRollupWorker`), and `ai_cost_rollup_month DATE NULL` (date of the last roll-up) to `organization_quotas`.

> **Migration 171 — AI RBAC permissions seed:** `171_seed_ai_permissions.sql` inserts the seven granular AI permission slugs (`ai.policy.read`, `ai.policy.write`, `ai.phrases.read`, `ai.phrases.write`, `ai.reply.draft`, `ai.reply.send`, `ai.providers.write`) into `permissions` and grants them to the `admin` role via `role_permissions`. Uses `INSERT IGNORE` for idempotent re-runs.

> **Migration 172 — `embedding_model` on ai_providers:** `172_add_embedding_model_to_ai_providers.sql` adds `embedding_model VARCHAR(120) NULL` to `ai_providers`. When populated and `VECTOR_RETRIEVAL_ENABLED=true`, the `vectorStoreService` uses this model via `llmProviderService.embed()` to generate embeddings for ChromaDB upserts and similarity queries in the RAG pipeline.

> **Migration 266 — FTTH OLT & ONU management tables (§7.1/§7.2):** `266_create_ftth_olt_onu_tables.sql` creates seven FTTH-specific tables: `olt_ports` (PON/uplink port inventory per OLT, with Tx/Rx optical power and ONU count), `onu_profiles` (service profile templates: T-CONT/GEM port/DBA/VLAN mapping), `onu_details` (per-ONU provisioning detail extending the `devices` row: SN, LOID/Password encrypted, state, ranging distance, profile assignment, WAN mode), `onu_optical_metrics` (per-ONU optical diagnostic time-series: Tx power, Rx power, temperature, voltage, bias current), `onu_whitelist` (MAC/SN allow-block list per OLT), `onu_omci_configs` (OMCI-style Wi-Fi SSID/password and WAN config records — delivery via OMCI/TR-069/SSH-CLI job layer), and `onu_firmware_jobs` (batch firmware upgrade and reboot scheduler: scoped to single ONU, PON port, or full OLT). OLTs and ONUs are existing device records (`type='olt'/'onu'`); these tables add GPON domain detail without a parallel device registry.

> **Migration 278 — CPE Inventory Lifecycle (§8.4):** `278_cpe_inventory_lifecycle.sql` extends `cpe_devices` with lifecycle_state ENUM (in_stock/assigned/active/returned/rma), subscriber_id FK to clients, subscriber_linked_at timestamp, and depreciation fields (purchase_cost, purchase_date, depreciation_method straight_line/declining_balance, useful_life_months, salvage_value) via INFORMATION_SCHEMA-guarded ALTERs. Creates `cpe_lifecycle_history` (immutable FSM audit trail). Seeds 5 permissions (cpe_inventory.view/manage/swap/link + cpe_lifecycle_history.view).

> **Migrations 279–281 — WISP/Wireless Management (§9.1):** `279_wireless_ap_sector_tables.sql` creates 5 tables: `ap_channel_plans` (channel registry per site for frequency conflict avoidance), `ap_sector_configs` (RF configuration per AP sector device — azimuth/frequency/power/encryption), `wireless_client_sessions` (append-only CPE client state snapshots per AP poll), `ap_command_jobs` (remote AP command queue for power/frequency/reboot), `wireless_channel_interference` (RF interference records). Also adds wireless RF metric columns to `snmp_metrics` and `snmp_metrics_1month` (noise_floor_dbm, air_util_pct, gps_sync_status, snr_db, ccq_pct, tx/rx_rate_mbps) via stored-procedure guards. `280_wireless_vendor_oid_seeds.sql` adds SNMP profiles for Mimosa, Tarana, Radwin, Siklu and extends Ubiquiti/MikroTik profiles with RF OIDs. `281_seed_wireless_permissions.sql` seeds 15 permissions across 5 permission sets.

> **Migrations 284–285 — RF Metrics + Spectrum Scans (§9.3):** `284_rf_spectrum_scan_tables.sql` creates `spectrum_scan_results` table (scan_type ENUM, frequency range, scan_data JSON array of {freq_mhz, power_dbm}, peak_interference_dbm, recommended_channel_mhz, status ENUM); adds GPS sync OIDs for Ubiquiti airOS (ubntAirIfGpsSync 1.3.6.1.4.1.41112.1.6.1.2.1.5) and Mimosa Networks (mimosaGpsSync 1.3.6.1.4.1.43356.2.1.2.1.1.8); seeds `wireless_ap_sector_poll` scheduled task (every 5 minutes, snmp_poll type). `285_seed_rf_metrics_permissions.sql` seeds 4 permissions: spectrum_scans.view/create/delete + rf_metrics.view.

### Venta al Público en General (Factura Pública)

Mexican tax law (SAT CFDI 4.0) requires every sale to be fiscally documented, even when the client does not request an individual factura. For MX-locale contracts where the client opts out of individual CFDIs, the ISP uses the **"venta al público en general"** mechanism:

1. **Per-contract `facturar` flag:** Each contract has a `facturar` BOOLEAN column (default `FALSE`). Set to `TRUE` when the client wants an individual CFDI for that contract's invoices, `FALSE` when they do not. The same client can have some contracts with `facturar = TRUE` and others with `facturar = FALSE`.

2. **Client MX profile requirement:** If ANY of a client's contracts has `facturar = TRUE`, the client MUST have a `client_mx_profiles` row with valid SAT data (RFC, razon_social, regimen_fiscal, codigo_postal_fiscal). This is enforced at the application layer. If ALL contracts have `facturar = FALSE`, the profile is optional.

3. **RFC uniqueness:** A stored generated column (`rfc_unique_check`) evaluates to `NULL` for `XAXX010101000` and to the actual RFC otherwise. The UNIQUE constraint on this column allows multiple público-en-general profiles while still enforcing uniqueness for real RFCs.

4. **Normal invoicing continues:** Invoices are still created for `facturar = FALSE` contracts (for internal billing, collection, and payment tracking), but no individual CFDI is stamped for them.

5. **Periodic factura pública aggregation:** All invoices from `facturar = FALSE` contracts are aggregated into a periodic factura pública document (`factura_publica_invoices`) per the SAT `InformacionGlobal` node requirements:
   - **Periodicidad** (`c_Periodicidad`): `01`=Diario, `02`=Semanal, `03`=Quincenal, `04`=Mensual, `05`=Bimestral
   - **Meses** (`c_Meses`): `01`–`12` individual months; `13`–`18` bimonthly periods
   - **Año**: Fiscal year

6. **Invoice-to-factura-pública linking:** The `factura_publica_invoice_items` junction table links each invoice to its parent factura pública. Each invoice can belong to at most one factura pública (enforced by UNIQUE constraint on `invoice_id`).

7. **Factura pública receptor data:** When the factura pública is stamped, the `cfdi_documents` receptor snapshot uses: RFC `XAXX010101000`, Nombre `PUBLICO EN GENERAL`, RegimenFiscal `616` (Sin obligaciones fiscales), UsoCFDI `S01` (Sin efectos fiscales).

8. **Predominant FormaPago calculation (migration 091):** Every CFDI 4.0 requires exactly one `FormaPago` code. When a factura pública aggregates invoices paid via different methods, call `fn_predominant_forma_pago(factura_publica_invoice_id)` at stamp time to obtain the correct code. The function sums `payments.amount` grouped by `sat_forma_pago` and returns the code with the highest total. If two or more codes tie, or if no payments are recorded, it returns `'99'` (Por definir) per SAT Anexo 20 rules.

9. **Unpaid invoice exclusion (migration 091):** Only invoices with `status = 'paid'` may be included in a stamped factura pública. This is enforced by two database-level safeguards: a BEFORE INSERT trigger on `factura_publica_invoice_items` rejects linking any invoice that is not yet paid, and a BEFORE UPDATE trigger on `factura_publica_invoices` blocks transitioning `status` to `'stamped'` if any linked invoice is not paid. Both raise SQLSTATE '45000' on violation. This prevents the ISP from paying taxes on revenue it has not yet collected.

> **This feature only applies to MX-locale clients.** The existing locale enforcement triggers (migration 087) prevent CFDI documents from being created for non-MX clients. Non-MX clients are not affected by the `facturar` flag.

### Storage Folders

The `storage/` directory holds user-uploaded and system-generated files organized by entity type. The `files` database table stores metadata and paths for every stored file.

| Folder | Entity Type | File Categories |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|
| `storage/devices/` | Devices | device_history, evidence |
| `storage/clients/` | Clients | client_file, notification_log |
| `storage/tickets/` | Tickets | chat_history, document |
| `storage/organizations/` | Organizations | isp_info, sat, online_payment, map, logo |
| `storage/backups/` | System | backup |

## Getting Started

### Connection Types

Each contract specifies a `connection_type` that determines how the client connects and whether RADIUS is required:

| Connection Type | Description | RADIUS Required | IP Management |
|-----------------|-------------|-----------------|---------------|
| `pppoe` (default) | PPPoE session — IPv4 only via RADIUS | Yes — create a `radius` record linked to the contract | `radius.ip_address` (static) or `radius.ipv4_pool_id` pool-assigned (dynamic) |
| `pppoe_dual` | PPPoE session — dual-stack IPv4 + IPv6 via RADIUS | Yes — create a `radius` record with IPv4 and IPv6 fields | `radius.ip_address` + `radius.ipv6_address` / `radius.ipv6_delegated_prefix` (static) or pool-assigned via `radius.ipv4_pool_id` + `radius.ipv6_pool_id` (dynamic) |
| `static` | Static IPv4 — IP assigned directly, no PPPoE | No | `ip_assignments` row linked to the contract via `contract_id` |
| `dual` | Dual-stack static IPv4 + IPv6 — no PPPoE | No | One IPv4 + one IPv6 `ip_assignments` row, both linked to the contract |

### IPv4 / IPv6 / Dual-Stack Support

The schema is ready for IPv4-only, IPv6-only, and dual-stack deployments:

| Table | IPv4 | IPv6 | Dual-Stack Notes |
|-------|------|------|------------------|
| `ip_pools` | `ip_version = '4'` | `ip_version = '6'` | Create separate pools per address family; link both to the same site |
| `ip_assignments` | Single address (`prefix_len` = NULL) | Address or prefix (`prefix_len` = 48, 56, 64, …) | One row per address/prefix; a dual-stack subscriber gets one v4 + one v6 assignment |
| `radius` | `ip_address` (static) or `ipv4_pool_id` (dynamic) | `ipv6_address` + `ipv6_delegated_prefix` / `ipv6_prefix_len` (static) or `ipv6_pool_id` (dynamic) | All IPv6 fields coexist with IPv4 for seamless dual-stack PPPoE sessions; `nas_id` links the subscriber to its NAS |
| `nas` | `ip_address` | `ipv6_address` | Both addresses stored per NAS for dual-stack management |
| `devices` | `ip_address` | `ipv6_address` | Both addresses stored per device for dual-stack management |

### SNMP Monitoring

The `devices` table includes SNMP configuration columns (`snmp_enabled`, `snmp_community`, `snmp_version`, `snmp_port`) so that both **client CPE** and **POP infrastructure** devices can be polled. Collected metrics are stored in a three-tier structure for efficient querying and long-term retention:

| Data Tier | Resolution | Retention | Description |
|-----------|------------|-----------|-------------|
| `snmp_metrics` (raw) | 5-min polls | 90 days | Wide table — one row per device/interface per poll (8× fewer rows than narrow EAV); monthly partitions enable instant `DROP PARTITION` retention |
| `snmp_metrics_1hr` | Hourly averages | 1 year | Wide table — per-metric `avg_*` / `min_*` / `max_*` columns; idempotent rollup via `INSERT … ON DUPLICATE KEY UPDATE` |
| `snmp_metrics_1day` | Daily averages | 3+ years | Wide table — aggregated from `snmp_metrics_1hr`; kept indefinitely |

#### Supported SNMP Metrics

Each raw poll row stores up to eight metrics as individual columns:

| Column | Type | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| `if_in_octets` | `BIGINT` | ifInOctets — bytes received |
| `if_out_octets` | `BIGINT` | ifOutOctets — bytes transmitted |
| `if_in_errors` | `BIGINT` | ifInErrors — inbound error count |
| `if_out_errors` | `BIGINT` | ifOutErrors — outbound error count |
| `cpu_usage` | `SMALLINT` | CPU utilization percentage |
| `memory_usage` | `SMALLINT` | Memory utilization percentage |
| `signal_strength` | `INTEGER` | Wireless signal strength in dBm |
| `latency_ms` | `DECIMAL(10,2)` | ICMP ping latency in milliseconds |

The optional `interface_id` column stores the SNMP `ifIndex` or `ifDescr` for interface-level metrics (e.g., multiple interfaces on a router or switch).

#### Scale Targets

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Devices | 6,000 |
| Poll interval | 5 minutes |
| Rows per day (raw) | ~1.73 million |
| Raw retention | 90 days (~155 million rows) |
| Raw table design | Wide — no FK, no per-row OID, monthly partitions |

#### Automated Rollup & Retention (MySQL Event Scheduler)

Data aggregation and retention are handled by MySQL stored procedures and scheduled events — the MySQL equivalent of TimescaleDB continuous aggregates and retention policies. The MySQL Event Scheduler must be enabled:

```sql
SET GLOBAL event_scheduler = ON;
```

Or in `my.cnf` / `my.ini`:

```ini
[mysqld]
event_scheduler = ON
```

> **⚠️ Prerequisite:** `event_scheduler = ON` is **required** for automated SNMP rollup/retention and `connection_logs` partition maintenance. If it is disabled, SNMP aggregation stops, old partitions accumulate past their retention windows, and `connection_logs` inserts will eventually fail when `p_future` is exhausted. Run the preflight check procedure (see [Preflight Check](#preflight-check-event-scheduler)) during deployment to detect this early.

| Event | Schedule | Action |
|-------|----------|--------|
| `evt_snmp_rollup_1hr` | Every hour at :05 | Calls `snmp_rollup_to_1hr()` — aggregates raw → hourly using high-watermark |
| `evt_snmp_rollup_1day` | Daily at 00:30 | Calls `snmp_rollup_to_1day()` — aggregates hourly → daily using high-watermark |
| `evt_snmp_retention` | Daily at 02:00 | Calls `snmp_apply_retention()` — purges hourly data older than 1 year |
| `evt_snmp_partition_maintenance` | Daily at 03:00 | Calls `snmp_maintain_partitions()` — adds future month partitions and drops expired ones (replaces batch DELETE for raw data retention) |

All rollup procedures use a **high-watermark** (`snmp_rollup_state` table) to track the last successfully processed timestamp, so missed runs catch up automatically rather than only looking back a fixed window. Rollup procedures use `INSERT … ON DUPLICATE KEY UPDATE` for idempotent re-runs. Raw data retention is instant (partition `DROP`) while hourly retention uses batch deletes (10 000 rows per iteration) since that table is much smaller.

### Connection Logs (Compliance & Usage)

The `connection_logs` table records every RADIUS accounting event (`start`, `stop`, `interim-update`) per contract, providing a complete audit trail of subscriber sessions for regulatory compliance. Each row is **self-contained** — it captures the subscriber identity, assigned IP address(es), NAS, and session counters at the time of the event, so the record remains valid even if the contract or client is later deleted.

| Column | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `contract_id` / `client_id` | Contract and client at time of session (no FK — compliance) |
| `username` | RADIUS username at time of session |
| `session_id` | RADIUS Acct-Session-Id |
| `ip_address` / `ipv6_address` / `ipv6_delegated_prefix` | IP address(es) assigned during the session |
| `nas_id` / `nas_ip_address` | NAS that authenticated the session |
| `event_type` | `start`, `stop`, or `interim-update` |
| `bytes_in` / `bytes_out` / `packets_in` / `packets_out` | Session traffic counters (at stop/interim) |
| `session_duration` | Duration in seconds (at stop) |
| `terminate_cause` | RADIUS Acct-Terminate-Cause (at stop) |

**Retention:** 2 years via monthly partition `DROP`, managed by `connection_logs_maintain_partitions()`.

> **⚠️ Requires `event_scheduler = ON`:** The scheduled event below will not run if the MySQL Event Scheduler is disabled. Without it, future partitions are never created (causing inserts to fail) and expired partitions are never dropped (violating the 2-year compliance retention window). See [Preflight Check](#preflight-check-event-scheduler) to validate this at deployment time.

| Event | Schedule | Action |
|-------|----------|--------|
| `evt_connection_logs_partition_maintenance` | Daily at 03:30 | Calls `connection_logs_maintain_partitions()` — adds future month partitions and drops expired ones (2-year retention) |

**Typical queries:**

```sql
-- Who had IP 10.0.1.42 on 2026-03-15?
SELECT * FROM connection_logs
WHERE ip_address = '10.0.1.42'
  AND event_at >= '2026-03-15' AND event_at < '2026-03-16';

-- All sessions for contract #123 in March 2026
SELECT * FROM connection_logs
WHERE contract_id = 123
  AND event_at >= '2026-03-01' AND event_at < '2026-04-01';

-- Total data usage per contract for billing period
SELECT contract_id,
       SUM(bytes_in)  AS total_download,
       SUM(bytes_out) AS total_upload
FROM connection_logs
WHERE event_type IN ('stop', 'interim-update')
  AND event_at >= '2026-03-01' AND event_at < '2026-04-01'
GROUP BY contract_id;
```

### Preflight Check: Event Scheduler

Migration `053` creates a `preflight_check_event_scheduler()` stored procedure that validates the MySQL Event Scheduler is enabled. Call it during deployment or application startup:

```sql
CALL preflight_check_event_scheduler();
```

If `event_scheduler` is **not** `ON`, the procedure raises a `SQLSTATE '45000'` error with a descriptive message explaining the risk and how to fix it. It returns silently when the scheduler is correctly enabled.

**Why this matters:**

| Consequence | Detail |
|-------------|--------|
| `connection_logs` insert failures | Without daily partition maintenance, `p_future` fills up and INSERTs start failing |
| Compliance retention violation | Partitions older than 2 years are never dropped, accumulating data beyond the regulatory window |
| SNMP data gap | Rollup and retention events stop running, leaving raw data unbounded |

**To enable the Event Scheduler:**

```sql
-- At runtime (resets on MySQL restart unless also set in my.cnf):
SET GLOBAL event_scheduler = ON;
```

```ini
# In my.cnf / my.ini (persistent across restarts):
[mysqld]
event_scheduler = ON
```

### SNMP OID Profile System

The SNMP OID profile system lets you customize which OIDs are polled for each device brand and model without changing any application code — just insert new rows into the profile tables.

#### How Profiles Work

Each `snmp_profiles` row is a named polling template that the poller selects for a device. Once a profile is selected, the poller walks every OID listed in `snmp_profile_oids` for that profile and stores each result in the corresponding `snmp_metrics` wide-table column (`metric_column`).

#### Profile Resolution Order

For every device where `snmp_enabled = TRUE`, the poller resolves its profile as follows:

1. **Explicit override** — if `devices.snmp_profile_id IS NOT NULL`, use that profile directly.
2. **Auto-match** — otherwise query `snmp_profiles` for the best match:
   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM snmp_profiles
   WHERE (manufacturer  = device.manufacturer  OR manufacturer  IS NULL)
     AND (device.model LIKE model_pattern       OR model_pattern IS NULL)
     AND (device_type   = device.type           OR device_type   IS NULL)
     AND status = 'active'
   ORDER BY manufacturer DESC, model_pattern DESC, device_type DESC
   LIMIT 1;
   ```
   More-specific matches (manufacturer + model_pattern + device_type) rank higher than wildcard rows.
3. **Default fallback** — if no profile matches, select the profile with `is_default = TRUE` and `status = 'active'`.
4. **Walk OIDs** — fetch all `snmp_profile_oids` rows for the resolved profile and poll each OID, storing results into `snmp_metrics` using the `metric_column` mapping.

#### Pre-Seeded Profiles

| Profile | `manufacturer` | Key Vendor OIDs |
|---------|---------------|-----------------|
| **Generic IF-MIB** *(default)* | `NULL` (any) | Standard IF-MIB (RFC 2863) interface counters + HOST-RESOURCES-MIB CPU/memory |
| **Ubiquiti airOS** | `Ubiquiti` | Enterprise `1.3.6.1.4.1.41112.*` OIDs for signal strength, CPU, memory |
| **MikroTik RouterOS** | `MikroTik` | Enterprise `1.3.6.1.4.1.14988.*` OID for wireless signal + HOST-RESOURCES-MIB |
| **Cambium Networks** | `Cambium` | Enterprise `1.3.6.1.4.1.161.*` OIDs for RSSI and CPU |

#### Adding a New Vendor Profile

To add a new brand or model without touching any code:

```sql
-- 1. Create the profile
INSERT INTO snmp_profiles (name, manufacturer, model_pattern, device_type, snmp_version, poll_interval_sec, description)
VALUES ('Huawei OLT', 'Huawei', NULL, 'olt', 'v2c', 300, 'Huawei OLT devices — MA5800 series');

-- 2. Map the OIDs
INSERT INTO snmp_profile_oids (profile_id, oid, metric_column, label, oid_type, is_per_interface, sort_order)
VALUES
    (LAST_INSERT_ID(), '1.3.6.1.2.1.2.2.1.10', 'if_in_octets',  'Inbound Octets',  'counter', TRUE,  10),
    (LAST_INSERT_ID(), '1.3.6.1.2.1.2.2.1.16', 'if_out_octets', 'Outbound Octets', 'counter', TRUE,  20),
    (LAST_INSERT_ID(), '1.3.6.1.4.1.2011.6.128.1.1.2.51.1.4', 'cpu_usage', 'Huawei CPU (%)', 'gauge', FALSE, 30);
```

The next poll cycle will automatically use the new profile for all Huawei OLT devices.

### Inventory / Warehouse

The inventory system tracks spare equipment and materials across multiple physical warehouses. Each warehouse can define granular storage locations using **aisle**, **column**, and **shelf** identifiers. Items move through the system via an immutable transaction log, supporting the full lifecycle from purchase to deployment or sale.

#### Tables Overview

| Table | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| `warehouses` | Physical storage locations (multiple warehouses supported) |
| `inventory_items` | Product catalog — each row is a type of spare part or material |
| `inventory_stock` | Current quantity on hand per item per warehouse location (aisle/column/shelf) |
| `inventory_transactions` | Immutable movement log — every receive, assignment, sale, transfer, return, or adjustment |

#### Transaction Types

| Type | Direction | Description |
|------|-----------|-------------|
| `receive` | Inbound (+) | New stock received from a supplier |
| `assign_to_job` | Outbound (−) | Item used on a field work order (`work_orders`) |
| `sell_to_client` | Outbound (−) | Item sold directly to a client (optionally linked to an invoice) |
| `transfer_out` | Outbound (−) | Item sent to another warehouse location |
| `transfer_in` | Inbound (+) | Item received from another warehouse location |
| `return` | Inbound (+) | Item returned from a job or client |
| `adjustment` | +/− | Manual stock correction (shrinkage, recount, etc.) |

#### Item Categories

`antenna`, `cable`, `router`, `switch`, `onu`, `olt`, `cpe`, `connector`, `power_supply`, `enclosure`, `tool`, `other`

#### Typical Queries

```sql
-- Current stock for all items across all warehouses
SELECT ii.name, w.name AS warehouse, s.aisle, s.col, s.shelf, s.quantity
FROM inventory_stock s
JOIN inventory_items ii ON ii.id = s.item_id
JOIN warehouses w ON w.id = s.warehouse_id
ORDER BY ii.name, w.name;

-- Items below reorder level
SELECT ii.name, ii.reorder_level, SUM(s.quantity) AS total_on_hand
FROM inventory_items ii
JOIN inventory_stock s ON s.item_id = ii.id
WHERE ii.reorder_level IS NOT NULL AND ii.status = 'active'
GROUP BY ii.id
HAVING total_on_hand < ii.reorder_level;

-- All transactions for a specific job
SELECT it.*, ii.name AS item_name
FROM inventory_transactions it
JOIN inventory_stock s ON s.id = it.stock_id
JOIN inventory_items ii ON ii.id = s.item_id
WHERE it.job_id = 42;

-- Revenue from inventory sales in March 2026
SELECT ii.name, SUM(ABS(it.quantity)) AS units_sold,
       SUM(ABS(it.quantity) * it.unit_price) AS revenue
FROM inventory_transactions it
JOIN inventory_stock s ON s.id = it.stock_id
JOIN inventory_items ii ON ii.id = s.item_id
WHERE it.transaction_type = 'sell_to_client'
  AND it.created_at >= '2026-03-01' AND it.created_at < '2026-04-01'
GROUP BY ii.id;
