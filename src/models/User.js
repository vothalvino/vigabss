   * value, so no caller can ever pass them in `roles`. Without special

   * `users.role='admin'` + `organization_users.role='owner'` for org 1 — the
   * exact shape that regresses. Fix: when the caller asks for `'admin'`,
   * ALSO match a membership role of `'owner'` — 'owner' outranks 'admin'
   * everywhere else in this codebase (`requireRole('owner','admin')`
   * patterns, `userTunnelService`'s `ou.role IN ('owner','admin')`,
   * `roles.js`'s owner guards). This expansion applies ONLY to the
   * membership branch (`'owner'` can never appear in the legacy branch,
   * since it isn't a `users.role` value).
   *
   * Deliberately does NOT expand `'manager'` the same way: a user whose
   * membership role is `'manager'` (even with a legacy `users.role` of
   * `'admin'`) is intentionally EXCLUDED — their authoritative role really is
   * manager, and this codebase's admin-tier shortcuts are owner/admin only.
   * (Under the OLD users.role-only query, such a user WAS included via the
   * legacy shortcut; this is a deliberate product-semantics change now that
   * resolution is membership-authoritative, not a regression.)
   *

   * own email leg on `recipient.email` truthiness.
