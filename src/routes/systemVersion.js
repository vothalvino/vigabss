// GET /api/v1/system/version — what this instance is running, and (only when
// the operator has left checks enabled) whether a newer main commit exists.
//
// INSTALL OPERATOR ONLY. Gated on the explicit users.is_install_operator fact,
// not a role or permission slug, because the audience is a property of the
// INSTALL rather than a tenant. VigaBSS is multi-tenant: a reseller's org-admin
// has no shell on the box and cannot upgrade it, so showing them "a newer version
// is available" is noise they can never act on — and tells a tenant how often
// their provider ships.
//
// POST /api/v1/system/deploy — ask the host to redeploy.
// GET  /api/v1/system/deploy — the newest request, and whether the host agent
//                              is alive to service it.
//
// THE APP HAS NO PRIVILEGE HERE AND MUST NOT ACQUIRE ANY. POST inserts a row.
// That is all it does. A systemd timer running as root OUTSIDE the container
// (deploy-agent.sh) claims that row and runs redeploy.sh with no arguments.
//
// The obvious implementation — mounting the Docker socket into this container —
// is root on the host, so any RCE here would own the machine rather than the
// app. It was refused for the TLS renew button and is refused here.
//
// The request carries NO TARGET on purpose: a commit or image column would give
// a compromised app an arbitrary-image-deploy primitive, which is most of what
// the socket would have given away. Worst case with the app fully compromised
// is "trigger a redeploy of the signed image that was going to be deployed
// anyway".
