// Org scoping (j36)

// ScheduledTask declares hasOrgScope=false, and BaseModel omits the org
// predicate SILENTLY when it does — so list/get/update/delete ran unscoped and
// one tenant could see, edit and DELETE another tenant's scheduled jobs.
//
// It could not simply be flipped to true. Global system tasks are seeded with
// `SELECT NULL` for the org ON PURPOSE — data_retention, the config-backup
// pull, apply_late_fees, the TLS monitor — and a plain `organization_id = ?`
// would hide every one of them from every tenant, which is worse than the leak
// it fixes: the operator would believe nothing is scheduled.
//
// So it needs `organization_id = ? OR organization_id IS NULL`, which BaseModel
// cannot express. Same shape, and the same treatment, as the shared NULL-org
// tax rates in #566: READS admit the global rows and flag them, WRITES refuse
// them. A global task belongs to the install, not to whichever tenant found it
// first — one org disabling data_retention for everybody is exactly the kind of
// silent cross-tenant damage this job is about.

 * Refuse writes to a GLOBAL (NULL-org) task.
 *
 * This guard answers exactly one question — "is the target global?" — and
 * nothing else. It is NOT a tenancy check: a task owned by ANOTHER
 * organization is not global, so this waves it through by design. Strict
 * ownership is BaseModel's job, via ScheduledTask.hasOrgScope, and that is
 * the half #582 was missing: with the flag false, "not global" meant "no
 * predicate at all" and one tenant could edit another tenant's task.
 *
 * Keeping the two concerns separate is deliberate. Folding ownership in here
 * would put tenancy enforcement in a route helper for one table, where the
 * next table would have to reimplement it; leaving it in the model means every
 * verb — update, delete, restore — gets it without being asked.
