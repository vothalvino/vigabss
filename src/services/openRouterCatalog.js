// =============================================================================
// VigaBSS 5.0 — OpenRouter model catalog
// =============================================================================
// OpenRouter fronts hundreds of models from many vendors, and the roster changes
// most weeks. A hardcoded list is stale by the next release and quietly denies
// operators the model they are paying for, so the catalog is fetched from
// OpenRouter's PUBLIC model endpoint and cached.
//
// WHY THE BACKEND FETCHES IT, not the browser:
//   • one fetch serves every admin in every org, instead of one per page view
//   • the page's CSP does not have to allow a third-party origin
//   • an air-gapped install fails in one place, with one clear message
//
// WHEN IT FETCHES: only while an admin is actually configuring an OpenRouter
// provider. There is no timer and no startup call. An install that never touches
// OpenRouter never contacts openrouter.ai — the same rule the update check
// follows, and the reason a billing system can pass a security review.
//
// The endpoint needs no credentials, so no key is sent and nothing identifies
// the install.
//
// PRICING COMES FROM THE SAME PAYLOAD, and that matters beyond the picker:
// llmProviderService's static PRICE_TABLE knows none of these models, so every
// OpenRouter call would log "unknown model" and record cost 0 — silently wrong
// numbers on the cost dashboard. Rates are per-token and quoted separately for
// prompt and completion, so they are also more accurate than the single blended
// figure the static table uses.
