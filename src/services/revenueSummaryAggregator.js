// VigaBSS 5.0 — monthly revenue summary aggregation
// =============================================================================
// Fills revenue_summary, which five queries in reportService read and nothing
// ever wrote. `populate_revenue_summary` returned the string "populated by
// MySQL scheduled event" for an event that was never written — and returning a
// message counts as success, so the task went green nightly while the Churn
// Revenue Impact and Capacity Forecast reports had nothing to work with.
//
// Same shape as networkHealthAggregator (j52), same reasoning: a task in
// taskRunner is testable, logged and fails visibly; a MySQL EVENT is none of
// those.
//
// ── The definitions, because every one of them is a choice ───────────────────
//
// MRR   Contract price normalised to a month. A contract's price is
//       COALESCE(contracts.price_override, plans.price) and its cycle is
//       COALESCE(contracts.billing_cycle, plans.billing_cycle) — the override
//       columns exist on both, and using the plan's price while ignoring the
//       contract's cycle (or vice versa) is the obvious way to get this subtly
//       wrong. An annual contract contributes price/12, not price.
//
// ACTIVE Contracts with status 'active' whose start_date has passed and whose
//       end_date has not, evaluated AT THE END OF THE PERIOD rather than today.
//       Recomputing an old month must not describe it using today's roster.
//
// CHURN Contracts that reached cancelled/terminated/expired with an end_date
//       inside the period. end_date is the only date this schema records for
//       an ending — there is no cancelled_at — so a contract cancelled without
//       one is not counted rather than being attributed to an arbitrary month.
//
// MONEY total_revenue is invoiced in the period (draft/cancelled/void excluded
//       — a draft is not revenue); total_collected is completed payments in
//       the period; total_outstanding is unpaid invoice value AS AT the end of
//       the period, not today, for the same reason as ACTIVE.
//
// CURRENCY One per organisation (Organization.getCurrency). revenue_summary's
//       unique key includes currency, so a future multi-currency org would add
//       rows rather than overwrite — but nothing here sums across currencies,
//       which would be meaningless.
