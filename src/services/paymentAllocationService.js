// VigaBSS 5.0 — Payment Allocation Service
// =============================================================================
// Shared logic between POST /payments/:id/allocate (single invoice, kept for
// API compatibility) and POST /payments/:id/allocate-auto (FIFO oldest→newest,
// multi-invoice waterfall). Both routes call the SAME "mark a fully-covered
// invoice paid + reconnect a suspended contract" logic and the SAME "client's
// payable invoices with a live balance_due" query, so the two endpoints
// cannot drift out of sync with each other (see PR brief "payment waterfall").
//
// invoices.status has NO 'partial'/'partially_paid' value in the ENUM
// (database/schema.sql) — a partially-allocated invoice is intentionally left
// in its current status (issued/sent/overdue); only a FULLY covered invoice
// flips to 'paid'. Do not invent an enum value here.
// =============================================================================

const db = require('../config/database');
const suspensionService = require('./suspensionService');

// Invoices in these statuses can receive a payment allocation. Mirrors the
// frontend's NON_PAYABLE_STATUSES set (frontend/src/pages/payments/
// PaymentActions.tsx: void/cancelled/paid/draft excluded) — keep both in sync.
const PAYABLE_STATUSES = ['issued', 'sent', 'overdue'];

 * standalone single-allocate route — NOT a conn/db object (see
 * suspensionService.logSuspensionEvent's header comment for why: mocked test
