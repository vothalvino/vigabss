// VigaBSS 5.0 — where INFRASTRUCTURE alerts go
// =============================================================================
// Host-level problems (TLS expiry today; disk, daemon or backup failures later)
// are not a tenant's business. They fanned out to the admins and managers of
// every active organization, which on a multi-tenant install means every tenant
// admin receives instructions for a machine they have no shell on — noise they
// cannot act on, plus a small disclosure about how the platform is hosted.
//
// The person who fixes host infrastructure is a property of the INSTALL. That
// is what `ops_alert_email` (migration 436) records, and `settings` is
// install-level, so the scope matches.
//
// One place, deliberately: this exists so the NEXT infrastructure alert has an
// obvious home rather than inventing its own recipient rule. Route anything
// host-level through here.
