// =============================================================================
// VigaBSS 5.0 — Inventory Sale Drawdown Service (Inventory Phase 2, §14.2)
// =============================================================================
// Decrements stock for a sale (an invoice line item linked to an
// inventory_items row) and writes a matching `sell_to_client` ledger row.
// Runs entirely on the CALLER's transaction connection — it never opens or
// commits its own transaction, so it can be composed into either:
//   • POST /invoices/:id/items (src/routes/invoices.js)
//   • POST /quotes/:id/convert-to-invoice (src/routes/quotes.js)
// without risking a partial write if a later step in the caller's
// transaction fails.
//
// Policy v1 (PR brief, user-confirmed):
//   • Drawdown always targets the org's EXISTING inventory_stock row with the
//     GREATEST quantity for that item — deterministic, no warehouse picker
//     yet (a later enhancement).
//   • If the item has no stock row anywhere for the org, one is created (at
//     quantity 0) at the org's first warehouse before the decrement, mirroring
//     the item_id+warehouse_id upsert POST /inventory/transactions already
//     does for 'receive'/'adjustment' (src/routes/inventory.js).
//   • Negative stock is ALLOWED — this never throws for insufficient stock.
//     Migration 390 drops the migration-127 negative-stock guard trigger for
//     exactly this reason: invoicing a linked product must never fail because
//     of a stock-count drift.
//
// The `execute` parameter is a bound query FUNCTION — `conn.execute.bind(conn)`
// — not a conn/db OBJECT. Both current call sites already issue their other
// transactional writes via `conn.execute`, and this codebase's jest mocks for
// `conn` and `db` are NOT interchangeable even though the real mysql2 objects
// both expose `.query()`/`.execute()` (see agent-memory
// shared-sql-helper-bound-exec-pattern.md).
// =============================================================================
