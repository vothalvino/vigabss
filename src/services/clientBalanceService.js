// =============================================================================
// VigaBSS 5.0 — Client Balance Service
// =============================================================================
// Computes a client's CURRENT account balance from source-of-truth billing
// data (invoices + payments) — NOT from client_balance_ledger.
//
// Why not the ledger: client_balance_ledger is written by SOME money paths
// (invoice generate, one-off invoice, payment record, credit note, refund)
// but not consistently ALL of them, and it has drifted in production — a
// client can have an open, unpaid invoice with NO ledger entry at all while
// an unrelated credit-note entry makes the ledger's running total read as a
// credit ("in credit" shown next to a genuinely unpaid invoice). The ledger
// stays exactly as it was — an audit trail / history view (GET
// /clients/:id/balance-ledger, GraphQL `Client.ledger`, the statement PDF) —
// this module is the SINGLE source for the headline "Account Balance" figure
// everywhere it is shown (GraphQL `Client.balance`/`balanceCurrency`, the AI
// support billing module, the support-context enrichment used by AI replies,
// and the client portal dashboard).
//
// balance = SUM(balance_due of payable invoices: issued/sent/overdue)
//         - SUM(unallocated remainder of completed payments: amount - allocated)
//         - SUM(total of standing credit notes: issued/applied)
//
// Credit notes are the ONE money instrument with no invoice/payment footprint
// at all — they historically reduced the balance only via their ledger entry,
// so a formula built purely on invoices+payments would silently drop a
// client's standing credit (adversarial review caught exactly this). Drafts
// (being prepared) and cancelled notes do NOT count — note this is *more*
// correct than the old ledger, which kept counting a credit note even after
// cancellation (no compensating entry is ever written).
//
// Positive = owed by the client, negative = the client is in credit — same
// sign convention the ledger used (postpaid semantics: ClientDetail's own
// comment, preserved here).
