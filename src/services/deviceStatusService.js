// =============================================================================
// VigaBSS 5.0 — Device Online/Offline State Machine
// =============================================================================
// Detects device up/down transitions from SNMP poll results and emits
// device.offline/device.online for the notification pipeline
// (notificationHooks.js). Neither snmpPoller.js nor pollerEngine.js ever
// wrote devices.status before this — it sat frozen at its schema default
// ('offline') forever, so nothing downstream that reads it (dashboards,
// alertService's device-scoped checks) ever reflected reality.
//
// Thresholds:
//   - >= 3 consecutive failed polls flips a device to 'offline' (unless it is
//     already 'offline' or 'maintenance' — 'maintenance' is never auto-flipped
//     either direction).
//   - The next successful poll after a detector-driven 'offline' resets the
//     failure counter and flips back to 'online', emitting device.online.
//   - Every device defaults to status='offline' from creation (schema
//     default), so a device that has simply never been polled yet is
//     'offline' with consecutive_poll_failures=0 — NOT a real detected
//     outage. Its first successful poll still flips the column to 'online'
//     (so the status ever reflects reality at all) but emits NOTHING — this
//     is the guard against a "every device in the fleet just came online"
//     notification stampede the moment polling starts for the first time
//     (e.g. right after this feature's first deploy).
//
// Concurrency: recordPollResult() is reachable from MORE than one scheduled
// task hitting the SAME device around the same time — snmp_discovery_poll
// (migration 254) and ftth_olt_chassis_poll (migration 269) are both `*/5`
// cron and both dispatch through snmpPoller.poll() over the same device set,
// each under its own per-task-name lock, so two concurrent calls for one
// device are routine, not a rare edge case. A naive "SELECT current state,
// decide in JS, then UPDATE" is a classic read-then-write race: two
// concurrent callers can both read the same pre-increment counter and both
// decide to flip + emit (duplicate bell/email), or a lost increment can
// silently reset flap detection. Every write below is instead an atomic
// conditional `UPDATE ... WHERE <guard>` — MySQL's row-level locking
// serializes concurrent UPDATEs to the same row, and `col = col + 1` is
// always evaluated against the row's current (locked, up to date) value, so
// increments are never lost. The emit decision is `affectedRows === 1` on
// the specific guarded flip statement: only the ONE caller whose UPDATE
// actually changed the row (matched its WHERE AND produced a different
// value) gets to emit — a losing concurrent caller's identical WHERE clause
// sees the already-updated row and matches zero rows once the winner's
// statement has committed. `affectedRows` reflects CHANGED rows (not merely
// matched rows) because the connection pool does not set the
// CLIENT_FOUND_ROWS capability flag (src/config/database.js) — that is fine
// here because every WHERE clause below is constructed so a match always
// implies a real change (the WHERE excludes the SET's target end-state).
