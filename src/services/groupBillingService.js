// =============================================================================
// FireISP 5.0 — Client-Group Shared Billing Service
// =============================================================================
// A client_group with billing_mode='shared' has a designated primary member.
// This service lets that primary VIEW the group's combined balance and PAY it
// on behalf of every member.
//
// Design (see PR): members keep their OWN invoices and balances — each member
// stays their own invoice recipient, which is correct for CFDI (the member's
// RFC is the receptor). "Shared" does NOT reassign invoices to the primary.
// Instead a group payment is a SINGLE payment recorded on the primary that is
// FIFO-allocated across the group's open invoices (all members, oldest→newest,
// the same waterfall order the per-client allocate-auto uses). Because a
// client's balance is computed allocation-aware on the INVOICE side
// (clientBalanceService), settling a member's invoice from the primary's
// payment correctly zeroes that member's balance, and a fully-allocated
// payment leaves no phantom credit on the primary. Any overpayment remains as
// ordinary unallocated credit on the primary.
//
// Cross-client allocation (primary's payment → a member's invoice) is scoped
// strictly to members of the SAME shared group here; the manual per-payment
// allocate/reallocate/reassign routes keep their same-client guards untouched.
