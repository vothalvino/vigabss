// =============================================================================
// VigaBSS 5.0 — is a newer release available?
// =============================================================================
// Answers two separate questions, and keeps them separate on purpose:
//
//   1. What commit is this instance running?  — always known, no network.
//   2. Is there a newer one?                  — needs an outbound call, and is
//                                               OFF unless an operator opts in.
//
// ON BY DEFAULT, OPT-OUT. A fresh install should tell its operator that a
// newer release exists without anyone first discovering that a variable exists
// and editing a file full of secrets to set it — an update notice nobody turns
// on notifies nobody.
//
// The cost is real and stated rather than hidden: this is the only outbound
// request VigaBSS makes on its own behalf. An air-gapped or
// management-network install should set FIREISP_UPDATE_CHECK=0, which is
// documented in .env.prod.example, docs/deployment.md and the Settings ->
// Version tab. Until it does, the failed request is cached for a day and
// logged at info — it never retries per page load and never surfaces an error.
//
// What it sends is unchanged and is what makes the default defensible: an
// unauthenticated GET with no body, no identifiers, no version and no
// telemetry.
//
// WHY AN ENV VAR AND NOT THE `settings` TABLE. That was the first design, and
// it is wrong here. `settings` is install-wide (no organization_id) but is
// written through PUT /settings/:key, which any org admin holds — verified on a
// live install: org A writes a key and org B reads the change. Storing the
// opt-in there would let any tenant switch on an outbound call the operator
// deliberately declined. An env var can only be set by whoever edits
// .env.prod — which is exactly, and only, the install operator this feature is
// for. (The `settings` cross-tenant write is filed separately; this feature
// simply must not be built on top of it.)
//
// WHAT IT SENDS. An unauthenticated GET to the public GitHub commits API. No
// identifiers, no version, no telemetry — the request body is empty and the
// response tells us the newest commit on main. GitHub's unauthenticated limit
// is 60/hour per IP, and this runs at most once per CHECK_TTL_MS, so a busy
// install cannot approach it.

// TWO DIFFERENT CADENCES, and conflating them made this feature useless.
//
// "Do not nag more than once a day" is about the BANNER, and is handled by its
// dismissal (UpdateAvailableBanner keeps a per-day flag). "How stale may the
// answer be" is this, and it was also set to a day — which meant the check ran
// exactly ONCE PER DEPLOY: at the moment the operator had just deployed HEAD,
// so the answer was guaranteed to be "up to date", and then froze for 24h.
// Anyone deploying more often than daily would never once see an update
// reported. Reproduced before changing it.
//
// 15 minutes is 4 requests/hour per install, against GitHub's unauthenticated
// limit of 60/hour per IP — comfortable even for several installs behind one
// NAT.

// `latestSha || error`, which left one case uncached: a 200 whose body has no
// string `sha` — a rate-limit message, or an intercepting corporate/ISP TLS
// proxy, both realistic for this product. Both fields end up null, the guard
// reads falsy, and the outbound call repeats on EVERY request forever. `at` is
// stamped on every outcome, so it cannot have that hole.
