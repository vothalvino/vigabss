/**
 * Reject fiscal figures that contradict what the resolver says should apply.
 * Used on CREATE (invoices, quote conversion) and on the UPDATE path for an
 * edit that STRIPS the tax off an invoice. Both directions, because both
 * produce a false statement to SAT on a document that cannot be un-sent:
 *
 *   * tax present on an IVA-EXEMPT client;
 *   * NO tax at all when a non-zero rate applies — the invoice then stamps as
 *     ObjetoImp=01 with no Impuestos node, positively asserting to the tax
 *     authority that the sale was not taxable.
 *
 * REJECTS rather than rewriting. The caller has already seen and approved these
 * figures — an operator who sent 1000.00 and gets back an invoice for 1160.00
 * has been given a document they never agreed to. A 422 is recoverable; a
 * silently altered fiscal total is not.
 *
 * Deliberately narrow, so it cannot break the deployments it does not concern:
 *
 *   * it compares against resolveTaxContext rather than re-deriving locale
 *     rules, so a non-MX org — or an MX org that has genuinely configured a 0%
 *     default — resolves to rate 0 and is never blocked;
 *   * it only fires when tax is ENTIRELY absent, never on a mismatched non-zero
 *     rate. An invoice legitimately carrying a different rate (a reduced rate,
 *     a mixed-rate document, a per-line override) stays valid;
 *   * an exempt client is always allowed to carry zero.
 *
 * NOTE THE MISSING PARAMETER. This deliberately does NOT pass the caller's
 * tax_rate_id through to the resolver, and must not be "fixed" to do so. The
 * question here is what SHOULD apply to this client, which has to be answered
 * independently of what the caller claimed — feeding their own rate id back in
 * makes the check circular ("is the caller's rate consistent with the caller's
 * rate?") and it always passes.
 *
 * That is not hypothetical: migration 121 seeds a SHARED rate
 * ('Tax Exempt', 0.0000, organization_id NULL, status 'active') and the
 * explicit-id branch of resolveTaxContext admits organization_id IS NULL by
 * design, so `{subtotal: 1000, total: 1000, tax_rate_id: <Tax Exempt>}` would
 * resolve to rate 0 and walk straight through this guard.
 *
 * Consequence worth knowing: an operator cannot justify a zero-tax document by
 * selecting a 0% rate on it. A genuinely zero-rated sale is expressed by
 * marking the client IVA-exempt, or by the org configuring a 0% default — both
 * of which are decisions someone makes once and on purpose, which is the point.

 * — a one-row-per-org atomic counter — instead of the old
 * `SELECT COUNT(*) FROM invoices ...` + 1 pattern, which is a non-locking
 * read: two concurrent callers for the same org could read the same count
 * and both attempt to INSERT the same invoice_number, hitting the
 * uq_invoices_org_number unique-key 500.
 *
 * `organization_id` is NULL for single-tenant deployments; the sequence
 * table uses sentinel `0` as its primary key for that bucket (a nullable PK
 * column wouldn't work — MySQL doesn't de-duplicate NULL against itself).
 *
 * Two statements, deliberately NOT collapsed into a single
 * `INSERT ... ON DUPLICATE KEY UPDATE ... LAST_INSERT_ID(...)`:
 *
 *   1. `INSERT IGNORE` guarantees a row exists for this org — a no-op when
 *      one already does (every org that had invoices before migration 381
 *      was seeded; this only actually inserts for a brand-new org's very
 *      first invoice).
 *   2. `UPDATE ... SET next_number = LAST_INSERT_ID(next_number) + 1` is the
 *      documented MySQL idiom for simulating a sequence with a plain
 *      UPDATE (it works without an AUTO_INCREMENT column): `LAST_INSERT_ID(expr)`
 *      evaluates `expr` against the row's PRE-update value and remembers it
 *      as the connection's last-insert-id, and *always* runs — a bare UPDATE
 *      has no conditional branch the way `ON DUPLICATE KEY UPDATE` does, so
 *      `SELECT LAST_INSERT_ID()` afterward reliably reflects this call's
 *      pre-update `next_number` (the number to hand out) every time.
 *      (A single upsert statement can't offer this guarantee: on a fresh,
 *      non-conflicting INSERT into a table with no AUTO_INCREMENT column,
 *      the `ON DUPLICATE KEY UPDATE` clause — and therefore any
 *      `LAST_INSERT_ID(expr)` inside it — never executes, so
 *      `LAST_INSERT_ID()` would return a stale value from whatever this
 *      pooled connection last set it to.)
 *
 * The UPDATE takes an exclusive row lock for its duration under InnoDB, so
 * two concurrent callers for the same org serialize on step 2: the second
 * transaction's UPDATE blocks until the first commits (writes always read
 * the latest row, not a snapshot), then increments from the first caller's
 * already-advanced value — distinct, gapless numbers, no race window.
 *
 * @param {object} conn - An active connection/transaction (must expose

 *   - Refuses (422 INVOICE_STAMPED) while a live CFDI exists — use the SAT
 *     cancellation flow instead.
 *   - Refuses (422 INVOICE_HAS_PAYMENTS) while payments are allocated — the
 *     operator must deallocate first (POST /payments/:id/unapply), which turns
 *     each payment into unallocated client credit ready to reallocate.
 *   - Refuses (422 INVOICE_CANCELLED) a SAT-cancelled invoice — that terminal
 *     state must not be re-labelled 'void'.
 *   - Idempotent: re-voiding an already-void invoice returns the record unchanged
 *     without touching allocations or the ledger.
 *   - Ledger: removes any prior void-reversal credit for this invoice, then
 *     zeroes the invoice's debit entries so it contributes $0 to the balance.
 *   - Writes an audit-log entry regardless of the starting status.
 *
 * Throws NotFoundError (404) if the invoice does not exist under the given org.
