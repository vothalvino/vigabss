// VigaBSS 5.0 — daily network health aggregation
// =============================================================================
// Fills network_health_snapshots, which has been read by three places since
// migration 117 and written by nothing. The `populate_network_health_snapshots`
// task returned the string "populated by MySQL scheduled event" — an event that
// was never written — so it reported SUCCESS every night while doing nothing,
// and /network-health has been empty for its entire existence.
//
// Implemented here rather than as a MySQL EVENT, deliberately: a task in
// taskRunner is testable, appears in logs, reports real row counts, and fails
// visibly. An event is invisible to every one of those.
//
// ── Where each number actually comes from ────────────────────────────────────
//
// LATENCY   snmp_metrics_1hr.avg/max_latency_ms, device-level rows only
//           (interface_id = ''). Averaging the hourly averages is a slight
//           approximation — it weights every hour equally regardless of how
//           many polls it contains — and that is the right trade here: the
//           alternative is re-reading raw snmp_metrics, which is the table the
//           1hr rollup exists to avoid scanning.
//
// THROUGHPUT ifInOctets/ifOutOctets are COUNTERS, not rates. Averaging them is
//           meaningless — avg_if_in_octets is the average VALUE of an
//           ever-increasing number. The bytes moved in an hour are
//           max - min, so:
//                Mbps = (max - min) * 8 / 3600 / 1e6
//           A counter reset (device reboot, 32-bit wrap) makes max < min, or
//           produces an absurd delta; those hours are DISCARDED rather than
//           clamped, because a wrapped counter tells us nothing true about that
//           hour and inventing a zero would drag the daily average down.
//           Summed across interfaces first, so the figure is device total
//           throughput rather than one interface's.
//
// UPTIME    From `outages`, not from SNMP. An unreachable device stops
//           producing metrics entirely, so "no rows" is indistinguishable from
//           "polling was off" — outages is the only record that means downtime.
//           Overlap of each outage window with the day, clamped to the day's
//           bounds; an ongoing outage counts to the end of the day (or now).
//
// PACKET LOSS  LEFT NULL. There is no packet-loss column in snmp_metrics_1hr
//           and no other source. The column stays NULL rather than being filled
//           with a zero, because a confident 0.00% on an SLA report is a lie,
//           and this whole job exists because something reported success while
//           knowing nothing.
