// =============================================================================
// VigaBSS 5.0 — TLS certificate expiry monitor
// =============================================================================
// The product already watches two kinds of certificate and neither is the one
// customers actually hit:
//   • check_certificate_expiry → subscriber_certificates (EAP-TLS for RADIUS)
//   • csd_expiry_monitor       → csd_certificates       (SAT fiscal signing)
//
// Nothing watched the server's own TLS certificate. Combined with a renewal
// loop that used to run `certbot renew --quiet` under `restart: unless-stopped`,
// a broken renewal produced no output, no alert and no failed container — the
// first symptom would have been the customer portal serving an expired
// certificate roughly 60-90 days later. (#538 removed the --quiet; this is the
// detection half.)
//
// Deliberately checks the LIVE endpoint rather than a file on disk: the app may
// run in a different container from nginx, certificates live in different paths
// across install methods (compose, k8s, install.sh), and what matters is what a
// browser is actually served — not what is sitting on a volume somewhere.
