// =============================================================================
// VigaBSS 5.0 — Post-install follow-up dispatcher (lead-installation workflow tail)
// =============================================================================
// N days after a service order completes (install done, contract live), the
// billing team gets a follow-up ticket to CALL THE CLIENT: is the service
// working well, are they happy with the install — the courtesy check that
// catches a struggling subscriber in week one instead of at churn time
// (user-specified purpose, 2026-08-04: satisfaction check, not invoice audit).
//
//   * N is PER ORG: the billing_followup_days org setting (settingsCatalog;
//     default 3, 0 disables). Resolved per order at dispatch time, so changing
//     the knob affects orders already waiting.
//   * Exactly once per order: service_orders.billing_followup_ticket_id is
//     both the marker and the audit link, claimed with a guarded UPDATE.
//   * 30-day dispatch window after the due date: an order whose follow-up is
//     more than 30 days overdue is skipped, not spammed — this also keeps the
//     first run after the feature ships from flooding billing with tickets
//     for every historical order.
//
// Runs from taskRunner as 'billing_followup_dispatcher' (hourly seed,
// migration 445). Global sweep — one run serves every organization.
