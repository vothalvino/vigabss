// =============================================================================
// VigaBSS 5.0 — org-scoping helpers for tables backfilled from a parent
// =============================================================================
// Several tables gained organization_id late, backfilled from a parent row
// (an outage from its site/device, a speed test from its client/contract).
// Every one of them lands in the same three-part shape, and this is the third
// copy — so it lives here rather than being hand-written a fourth time.
//
// THE PROBLEM THIS SOLVES
//
// BaseModel.hasOrgScope is a boolean: either it emits `organization_id = ?` or
// it emits NOTHING. Neither is correct for a backfilled table.
//
//   * false — the predicate is omitted SILENTLY, so list/get/update/delete run
//     unscoped and every tenant reads and writes every other tenant's rows.
//
//   * true, alone — a bare `organization_id = ?` HIDES every row the backfill
//     could not attribute. The parent columns are themselves nullable
//     ("NULL = single-tenant deployment"), so a single-tenant install
//     legitimately backfills to NULL and would see an empty page. That is the
//     anti-fix rejected in #582: worse than the leak, because it is silent.
//
// So reads admit `mine OR unattributed`, which BaseModel cannot express, and
// writes stay strict (`= ?`) with an adoption step in front.
//
// WHY ADOPTION
//
// A strict write predicate makes unattributed rows permanently un-editable —
// a legacy 'ongoing' outage would sit on every tenant's dashboard with no way
// to resolve it. Letting the first tenant that writes to one claim it fixes
// that, and the set only ever shrinks: once the owning migration has run,
// every new row is stamped at creation, so nothing new becomes unattributed.
