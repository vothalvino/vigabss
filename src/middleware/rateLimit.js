// VigaBSS 5.0 — Rate Limiting Middleware
// =============================================================================
// Tiered rate limits: public < general < authenticated < admin.
// Each tier has a different request quota.
// All thresholds are configurable via environment variables — see config/index.js.
//
// Per-tenant rate limiting is layered on top of the IP-based limits.
// Authenticated requests are additionally limited per organization so that one
// tenant's traffic cannot starve another.  The tenant limiter uses the shared
// cacheService (Redis when available, in-memory otherwise) for accurate counts
// across multiple app instances.
