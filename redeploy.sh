#
# VigaBSS production redeploy: pull main, pull the matching image, migrate,
# verify — as one command, from any directory.
#
# Install once as a global command:
#     sudo install -m 0755 /opt/fireisp/redeploy.sh /usr/local/bin/redeploy
# then redeploy any time with:
#     sudo redeploy
#
# Roll back to an earlier build (see "ROLLBACK" below):
#     sudo redeploy <commit-sha>
#
# NOTHING IS COMPILED HERE. CI builds, scans and publishes the image
# (.github/workflows/ci.yml → container-scan); this pulls it. That is the whole
# point: the in-image frontend build peaks around 1.43 GB RSS, and running it on
# the host while the stack was live evicted MySQL's buffer pools into swap. The
# evicted pages never came back, so swap ratcheted up with every deploy until
# the box thrashed hard enough to lock out SSH and need a reboot.
#
# The image is pinned to the EXACT commit being deployed, so `docker ps` and
# `git rev-parse HEAD` can never disagree.
#
# ROLLBACK — pass the target commit as an ARGUMENT, not an environment variable:
#
#     sudo redeploy 1a2b3c4
#
# `sudo` resets the environment by default (`Defaults env_reset` in sudoers), so
# a `VAR=x sudo redeploy` prefix is SILENTLY DISCARDED — the script would then
# fall through to HEAD and redeploy the newest build, i.e. the exact thing you
# were rolling back from, while exiting 0. The argument form cannot be stripped.
# FIREISP_IMAGE_TAG still works when the environment genuinely survives (running
# as root without sudo, or `sudo -E` with a SETENV sudoers tag).
#
# NOTE ON SCHEMA: rolling the image back does NOT roll the database back.
# Migrations already applied stay applied, and migrate.js below no-ops because
# the old image only knows its own (already-applied) files. Old code against a
# forward schema is fine for additive migrations and breaks on a DROP, RENAME or
# narrowed ENUM — check what the deploy you are undoing actually migrated.
#
# Non-standard install path? Set it in the environment of a ROOT shell (not as a
# sudo prefix, for the reason above):
#     sudo -i; FIREISP_DIR=/srv/fireisp redeploy
#
# `set -e` halts on the FIRST failed step, so a rejected pull or a missing image
# never goes on to migrate against a stale container.

error: could not pull ${FIREISP_IMAGE}

  Three likely reasons:

  1. 'denied' / 'unauthorized' — the ghcr package is PRIVATE and this host is
     not logged in. GitHub makes container packages private by DEFAULT, even
     for a public repository, so this bites once on a new install and never
     again. Either make the package public (GitHub → Packages → fireisp5.0 →
     Package settings → Change visibility), or authenticate here:

         echo "\$GHCR_PAT" | docker login ghcr.io -u <github-username> --password-stdin

  2. 'manifest unknown' — no image exists for this commit. Either CI has not
     finished (it publishes only AFTER the Trivy scan passes), or the build was
     SKIPPED because Docker Hub was unreachable. That case leaves the CI run
     GREEN with a warning annotation, so a green tick is not proof an image
     exists — open the run and check container-scan for "Container scan
     SKIPPED". If so, re-run that job, or deploy the previous commit:

         sudo redeploy <previous-commit-sha>

         https://github.com/vothalvino/fireisp5.0/actions

  3. 'no matching manifest for <platform>' — images are published for
     linux/amd64 and linux/arm64, which covers every mainstream VPS. If you
     are on something else (32-bit ARM, RISC-V), build from source instead:

         cd ${APP_DIR} && docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml -f docker-compose.build.yml --env-file .env.prod up -d --build

  Nothing has been changed on this host: the previous containers are still
  running and still serving.

# Reclaim superseded images. `docker image prune` is NOT enough here: it removes

# what makes dockerd/containerd hold ever more resident metadata, and why the
# interval between "the box got stuck" kept shrinking.
