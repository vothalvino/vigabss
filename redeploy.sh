# FireISP production redeploy: pull main, pull the matching image, migrate,
# verify — as one command, from any directory.
#
# Install once as a global command:
#     sudo install -m 0755 /opt/fireisp/redeploy.sh /usr/local/bin/redeploy
# then redeploy any time with:
#     sudo redeploy
#
# Roll back to an earlier build (see "ROLLBACK" below):
#     sudo redeploy <commit-sha>
#
# NOTHING IS COMPILED HERE. CI builds, scans and publishes the image
# (.github/workflows/ci.yml → container-scan); this pulls it. That is the whole
# point: the in-image frontend build peaks around 1.43 GB RSS, and running it on
# the host while the stack was live evicted MySQL's buffer pools into swap. The
# evicted pages never came back, so swap ratcheted up with every deploy until
# the box thrashed hard enough to lock out SSH and need a reboot.
#
# The image is pinned to the EXACT commit being deployed, so `docker ps` and
# `git rev-parse HEAD` can never disagree.
#
# ROLLBACK — pass the target commit as an ARGUMENT, not an environment variable:
#
#     sudo redeploy 1a2b3c4
#
# `sudo` resets the environment by default (`Defaults env_reset` in sudoers), so
# a `VAR=x sudo redeploy` prefix is SILENTLY DISCARDED — the script would then
# fall through to HEAD and redeploy the newest build, i.e. the exact thing you
# were rolling back from, while exiting 0. The argument form cannot be stripped.
# FIREISP_IMAGE_TAG still works when the environment genuinely survives (running
# as root without sudo, or `sudo -E` with a SETENV sudoers tag).
#
# NOTE ON SCHEMA: rolling the image back does NOT roll the database back.
# Migrations already applied stay applied, and migrate.js below no-ops because
# the old image only knows its own (already-applied) files. Old code against a
# forward schema is fine for additive migrations and breaks on a DROP, RENAME or
# narrowed ENUM — check what the deploy you are undoing actually migrated.
#
# Non-standard install path? Set it in the environment of a ROOT shell (not as a
# sudo prefix, for the reason above):
#     sudo -i; FIREISP_DIR=/srv/fireisp redeploy
#
# `set -e` halts on the FIRST failed step, so a rejected pull or a missing image
# never goes on to migrate against a stale container.

# Merging and immediately redeploying is a race, not an error: CI publishes only

# rather than failing on the first attempt.
#
# It retries `dc pull` itself rather than probing with `docker manifest
# inspect`. Probing meant classifying a DIFFERENT command's error text, and
# GHCR makes that unreliable in the one way that matters:
#
#   GHCR answers 401 "unauthorized" for a tag that does not exist, not 404.
#
# So a not-yet-published image is indistinguishable from a private package by
# message alone. Keying the wait off that text skipped the wait exactly when it
# was needed, and then reported "your package is private" — wrong twice.
# Retrying the real operation removes the guesswork: the thing being retried is
# the thing that has to succeed.
#
# Waiting is bounded and side-effect free, so retrying an error that turns out
# to be permanent costs one wait and then reports honestly.

  Two causes look identical here, because GHCR answers 401 "unauthorized" for a
  tag that does not exist rather than 404. After waiting ${IMAGE_WAIT}s, in
  order of likelihood:

  1. No image for this commit yet. CI publishes only after the security scan
     passes. The container-scan job is also allowed to go GREEN WITHOUT
     BUILDING when Docker Hub is unreachable, so a green tick is not proof an
     image exists -- open the run and look for "Container scan SKIPPED".

         https://github.com/vothalvino/fireisp5.0/actions

     Wait longer, or deploy the last commit that does have an image:

         FIREISP_IMAGE_WAIT=1800 sudo -E redeploy
         sudo redeploy <previous-commit-sha>

  2. The ghcr package is private and this host is not logged in. GitHub makes
     container packages private by DEFAULT even for a public repository, so
     this bites once on a new install and never again. Make the package public
     (GitHub -> Packages -> fireisp5.0 -> Package settings -> Change
     visibility), or authenticate:

         echo "\$GHCR_PAT" | docker login ghcr.io -u <github-username> --password-stdin
EOF
      ;;
    *"no space left on device"*)
      cat >&2 <<EOF
  The host is out of disk. Retained images are the usual cause -- this script
  keeps ${KEEP_IMAGES} for rollback and prunes the rest, but only after a
  SUCCESSFUL deploy, so a run of failures lets them accumulate.

      df -h ${APP_DIR}
      docker system df          # where the space actually went
      docker builder prune -f   # build cache only -- keeps every image

  To keep fewer rollback targets, lower FIREISP_IMAGE_KEEP (currently
  ${KEEP_IMAGES}) and run a successful deploy; the prune step then reclaims the
  rest. Do NOT reach for a blanket image prune: it deletes the older builds that
  make \`sudo redeploy <sha>\` a one-step rollback.
