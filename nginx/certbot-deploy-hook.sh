# VigaBSS 0.1.0-alpha.1 — Certbot deploy hook
#
# Automatically called by `certbot renew` when a certificate is successfully
# renewed.  Copies the renewed certificate and private key into the
# ./nginx/certs/ bind-mount so that the nginx container picks them up on its
# next periodic reload (every 6 hours).
#
# This script is mounted read-only into the certbot container at:
#   /etc/letsencrypt/renewal-hooks/deploy/copy-certs.sh
#
# Environment variables provided by certbot at hook time:
#   RENEWED_LINEAGE  — path to the renewed cert lineage, e.g.
#                      /etc/letsencrypt/live/isp.example.com
#   RENEWED_DOMAINS  — space-separated list of renewed domain names
# =============================================================================
