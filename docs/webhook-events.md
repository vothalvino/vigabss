## Configuring Webhooks

Register webhook endpoints via the API:

```bash
curl -X POST /api/v1/webhooks \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <token>" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "url": "https://your-app.example.com/webhook",
    "events": ["invoice.created", "payment.received", "contract.suspended"],
    "secret": "your-webhook-signing-secret"
  }'
```

Webhook deliveries are logged in the `webhook_deliveries` table. Failed deliveries are retried automatically using exponential backoff.

## Retry Policy

When a delivery fails (non-2xx response or network error), VigaBSS schedules automatic retries using **full-jitter exponential backoff**.

| Attempt | Base delay window |
|---------|-------------------|
| 1 | Immediate (synchronous with the triggering event) |
| 2 | 0 – 10 s |
| 3 | 0 – 20 s |
| 4 | 0 – 40 s |
| 5 | 0 – 80 s |
| n | 0 – min(3 600, 10 × 2^(n-1)) s |

The `webhook_retry` scheduled task runs every 5 minutes and processes all deliveries whose `next_retry_at` timestamp has passed.

Once **`max_retries`** (default 5) attempts are exhausted the row is set to `dead_letter` status and no further automatic retries occur.

### Dead-letter management

List dead-letter deliveries for review:

```bash
GET /api/v1/webhooks/dead-letters
```

Manually re-deliver a dead-letter entry (resets to attempt 1):

```bash
POST /api/v1/webhooks/deliveries/:id/redeliver
```

## Verifying Signatures

Each webhook delivery includes an `X-Webhook-Signature` header containing an HMAC-SHA256 digest of the request body using the webhook secret:

```javascript
const crypto = require('crypto');

function verifyWebhookSignature(body, signature, secret) {
  const expected = crypto
    .createHmac('sha256', secret)
    .update(body, 'utf8')
    .digest('hex');
  return crypto.timingSafeEqual(
    Buffer.from(signature, 'hex'),
    Buffer.from(expected, 'hex'),
  );
}
```
