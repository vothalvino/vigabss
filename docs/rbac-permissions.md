# VigaBSS 0.1.0-alpha.1 — RBAC Permission Matrix

> Extracted from `database/migrations/119_seed_default_roles_and_permissions.sql`.
>
> VigaBSS uses dot-notation permission slugs (`module.action`) enforced via `requirePermission()` middleware on API routes.

## Route Authorization

Routes without RBAC middleware (by design):

| Route | Reason |
|-------|--------|
| `auth.js` | Public endpoints (login, register, password reset) |
| `events.js` | SSE stream — authentication only, no permission needed |
| `metrics.js` | Internal Prometheus metrics endpoint |
| `paymentWebhooks.js` | Authenticated via HMAC signature (Stripe/Conekta) |
| `pdf.js` | Authentication only — users download their own documents |
| `twoFactor.js` | User self-service (own account only) |

All other 63 route files enforce RBAC via `requirePermission('module.action')`.
