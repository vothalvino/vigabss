## Suspension Troubleshooting

### Client reports they are suspended but already paid

1. **Check suspension logs:**
   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM suspension_logs
   WHERE contract_id = <contract_id>
   ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 5;
   ```

2. **Check invoice status:**
   ```sql
   SELECT id, invoice_number, total, status, balance_due
   FROM invoices WHERE contract_id = <contract_id>
   ORDER BY due_date DESC;
   ```

3. **Check if payment was applied:**
   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM client_balance_ledger
   WHERE client_id = <client_id>
   ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 10;
   ```

4. **Manual reconnect** (if payment is confirmed):
   ```bash
   # Via API
   curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/v1/suspension/reconnect \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer <token>" \
     -H "X-Org-Id: <org_id>" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"contract_id": <contract_id>}'
   ```

### Suspension rules not firing

- Check that `suspension_rules.is_enabled = TRUE` for the organization
- Check `scheduled_tasks` table to verify the suspension task is active
- Review logs: `grep "suspension" /var/log/fireisp/*.log`

---

## RADIUS Debugging

### CoA / Disconnect not reaching NAS

1. **Verify NAS configuration:**
   ```sql
   SELECT id, ip_address, coa_port, secret FROM nas WHERE id = <nas_id>;
   ```

2. **Check if the RADIUS account exists:**
   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM radius WHERE contract_id = <contract_id>;
   ```

3. **Test UDP connectivity** from the VigaBSS server to the NAS:
   ```bash
   nc -u -z <nas_ip> <coa_port>
   ```

4. **Check suspension_logs for CoA response:**
   ```sql
   SELECT coa_sent, coa_response FROM suspension_logs
   WHERE contract_id = <contract_id>
   ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 1;
   ```

### Common CoA responses

| Response | Meaning | Action |
|----------|---------|--------|
| `Disconnect-ACK` | Success — client disconnected | Normal |
| `Disconnect-NAK` | NAS rejected — session not found | Check if client is actually connected |
| `Timeout` | No response from NAS | Check network, firewall, NAS CoA port |
| `Socket error` | UDP send failed | Check server network configuration |

---

## CFDI Error Handling

### PAC stamping fails

1. **Check PAC provider credentials** in `.env`:
   ```
   PAC_PROVIDER=finkok
   PAC_USER=your-user
   PAC_PASSWORD=your-password
   PAC_URL=https://demo-facturacion.finkok.com
   ```

2. **Check CFDI document status:**
   ```sql
   SELECT id, invoice_id, status, pac_response, error_message
   FROM cfdi_documents WHERE invoice_id = <invoice_id>;
   ```

3. **Retry stamping:**
   ```bash
   curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/v1/cfdi/stamp/<cfdi_document_id> \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer <token>" \
     -H "X-Org-Id: <org_id>"
   ```

### Common CFDI errors

| Error | Cause | Fix |
|-------|-------|-----|
| `CSD401` | CSD certificate expired | Upload new CSD via `/api/v1/csd-certificates` |
| `RFC invalid` | Client RFC format error | Verify RFC in client record |
| `Uso CFDI invalid` | Wrong uso_cfdi for regimen | Check SAT catalog compatibility |
| `Duplicate UUID` | Already stamped | Check if CFDI was already generated |

---

## Database Maintenance

### Run migrations

```bash
npm run migrate
# Or in Docker:
docker exec fireisp-app node src/scripts/migrate.js
```

### Check migration status

```bash
npm run admin -- migration-status
```

### Database health check

```bash
npm run admin -- db-health
# Or via API:
curl http://localhost:3000/health?detail=true
```

### Manual backup

```bash
npm run backup
# Backs up to storage/backups/
```

---

## Alert System

### Alert rules not triggering

1. **Verify rules are enabled:**
   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM alert_rules WHERE organization_id = <org_id> AND is_enabled = TRUE;
   ```

2. **Check for recent SNMP data:**
   ```sql
   SELECT device_id, cpu_usage, memory_usage, polled_at
   FROM snmp_metrics
   WHERE polled_at > DATE_SUB(NOW(), INTERVAL 15 MINUTE)
   ORDER BY polled_at DESC LIMIT 10;
   ```

3. **Check alert evaluation task:**
   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM scheduled_tasks WHERE task_name = 'alert_evaluation';
   ```

4. **Review alert history:**
   ```sql
   SELECT ae.*, ar.name AS rule_name
   FROM alert_events ae
   JOIN alert_rules ar ON ar.id = ae.alert_rule_id
   WHERE ae.organization_id = <org_id>
   ORDER BY ae.created_at DESC LIMIT 20;
   ```

---

## 2FA / TOTP Issues

### User locked out of 2FA

1. **Use backup codes** — the user has 10 backup codes generated at setup time

2. **Admin disable 2FA** (if backup codes are lost):
   ```sql
   UPDATE users SET totp_enabled = FALSE, totp_secret = NULL, totp_backup_codes = NULL
   WHERE id = <user_id>;
   ```

### TOTP codes not working

- **Time sync**: TOTP requires server and device clocks to be within ±30 seconds (±1 step window)
- Verify server time: `date -u` should match UTC
- If using NTP: `timedatectl status` should show "System clock synchronized: yes"
- The TOTP implementation uses a ±1 window (allows 30-second drift each way)

### Generate new backup codes

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/v1/2fa/backup-codes \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <token>"
```

This regenerates 10 new codes and invalidates old ones.

---

## Incident Response (P1.9)

---

### Severity Matrix

| Severity | Definition | Response time | Examples |
|---|---|---|---|
| **SEV1** | Complete service outage or critical data loss; revenue impact or regulatory breach imminent | Page immediately; respond within **15 minutes** | Database down, RADIUS down, mass incorrect suspension, leaked credentials, TLS certificate expired |
| **SEV2** | Significant degradation; major feature unavailable; >10% of users impacted | Respond within **1 hour** | Payment gateway down, CFDI stamping failing, repeated 5xx on billing endpoints |
| **SEV3** | Minor degradation; workaround exists; single user or minor feature affected | Respond within **4 hours** | Single 4xx on non-critical endpoint, scheduled task delayed, PDF generation slow |
| **SEV4** | Informational; no active user impact; planned maintenance or cosmetic defect | Respond within **2 business days** | Log noise, non-critical warning alert, documentation bug |

---

### Incident Declaration Criteria

An incident should be **formally declared** (create an incident channel / ticket) when:

- Any SEV1 or SEV2 condition is met (see table above).
- An alert fires in PagerDuty / Opsgenie and is not resolved within 30 minutes.
- A customer reports a critical issue that cannot be immediately identified as a known configuration error.
- Any potential security breach is discovered (treat as SEV1 until scope is determined).

**Who can declare an incident:** Any on-call engineer or operator.

---

### Incident Workflow

```
1. DETECT   — alert fires or customer report received
2. DECLARE  — create incident (#incident-YYYYMMDD-NNN in chat, or ticket)
3. ASSIGN   — on-call engineer becomes Incident Commander (IC)
4. ASSESS   — determine severity within 5 min of declaration
5. MITIGATE — implement fastest available fix (rollback, feature flag, redirect)
6. RESOLVE  — confirm service restored; update status page
7. CLOSE    — post-mortem within 48 h (SEV1/SEV2) or 5 days (SEV3)
```

### SEV1 Scenarios — "What To Do When X Is On Fire"

#### 🔴 Database is down

1. **Verify**: `curl https://your-fireisp.domain/health?detail=true` → `db.connected: false`
2. **Check MySQL service**:
   ```bash
   docker exec fireisp-db mysqladmin -u root -p ping
   # or in K8s:
   kubectl exec -n fireisp deploy/mysql -- mysqladmin ping
   ```
3. **Check disk space** (MySQL will stop if disk is full):
   ```bash
   df -h /var/lib/mysql
   ```
4. **Check MySQL error log**:
   ```bash
   docker logs fireisp-db --tail 50
   kubectl logs -n fireisp -l app=mysql --tail 50
   ```
5. **Restart MySQL** (if no data-integrity issue):
   ```bash
   docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml --env-file .env.prod restart db
   ```
6. **Switch to read replica** (if write DB is down and read-only mode is acceptable):
   - Set `DB_READ_REPLICA_URL` in `.env` to the replica host; the app will serve reads from replica.
7. **If MySQL will not start**, initiate a DR restore: see `docs/dr-drill.md`.
8. **Customer comms**: Use SEV1 comms template below.

---

#### 🔴 RADIUS is down (clients cannot authenticate)

1. **Verify**: Multiple clients report no internet; check RADIUS logs on the NAS.
2. **Check FreeRADIUS service**:
   ```bash
   systemctl status freeradius
   journalctl -u freeradius --since "10 min ago"
   ```
3. **Test RADIUS authentication**:
   ```bash
   radtest <username> <password> <radius_host> 0 <secret>
   # Expected: Access-Accept
   ```
4. **Check database connectivity from RADIUS host**:
   ```bash
   mysql -h <DB_HOST> -u <DB_USER> -p -e "SELECT 1;"
   ```
5. **Check for CoA port issues** (UDP 3799 blocked):
   ```bash
   nc -u -z <nas_ip> 3799
   ```
6. **Restart FreeRADIUS** (if config is intact):
   ```bash
   systemctl restart freeradius
   ```
7. **Emergency workaround** — if RADIUS will not recover within 15 min,
   manually push a static route/lease to the NAS to allow known-good clients
   to pass while RADIUS is being restored.
8. **Customer comms**: Use SEV1 comms template below.

---

#### 🔴 Payment gateway is down

1. **Identify affected gateway** (Stripe, Conekta, or manual):
   ```sql
   SELECT name, is_active, last_error FROM payment_gateways WHERE organization_id = <org_id>;
   ```
2. **Check gateway status page** (Stripe: https://status.stripe.com, Conekta: https://status.conekta.com).
3. **Disable the failing gateway** temporarily to stop failed payment attempts from filling logs:
   ```sql
   UPDATE payment_gateways SET is_active = FALSE WHERE name = '<gateway>';
   ```
4. **Enable fallback gateway** if configured:
   ```sql
   UPDATE payment_gateways SET is_active = TRUE WHERE name = '<fallback_gateway>';
   ```
5. **Queue affected payments for retry** once gateway recovers — use the webhook retry queue or manually re-process.
6. **Customer comms**: Only if the outage affects self-service payment pages. Use SEV2 template.

---

#### 🔴 Mass suspension event (clients incorrectly suspended)

1. **Verify scope**:
   ```sql
   SELECT COUNT(*), DATE(created_at) FROM suspension_logs
   WHERE created_at > DATE_SUB(NOW(), INTERVAL 1 HOUR)
   GROUP BY DATE(created_at);
   ```
2. **Identify trigger** — check `scheduled_tasks` for the suspension job and audit logs for recent rule changes.
3. **Pause the suspension task** to prevent further incorrect suspensions:
   ```sql
   UPDATE scheduled_tasks SET is_enabled = FALSE WHERE task_name = 'auto_suspension';
   ```
4. **Bulk reconnect** affected clients:
   ```bash
   curl -X POST https://your-fireisp.domain/api/v1/suspension/bulk-reconnect \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer <admin_token>" \
     -H "X-Org-Id: <org_id>" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"reason": "Emergency reconnect — SEV1 investigation"}'
   ```
5. **Root cause**: Review the suspension rule that triggered, cross-reference with payment data.
6. **Customer comms**: Use SEV1 template (service interruption). Prepare a credit / goodwill gesture.

---

#### 🔴 Leaked credentials

1. **Immediately revoke all active JWT sessions**:
   - Change `JWT_SECRET` in `.env` / K8s Sealed Secret — all existing tokens will be invalidated instantly.
   - Rolling-restart the app pods to pick up the new secret.
2. **Rotate the leaked secret** in your secrets manager (see `docs/secrets-management.md`).
3. **Audit access** — query `audit_logs` for suspicious activity in the past 30 days:
   ```sql
   SELECT user_id, action, ip_address, created_at FROM audit_logs
   WHERE created_at > DATE_SUB(NOW(), INTERVAL 30 DAY)
   ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 500;
   ```
4. **Check for data exfiltration** in access logs (nginx / CloudFlare) — look for unusual `GET /export` or bulk-download patterns.
5. **Engage security/privacy counsel immediately** and record the affected data,
   people, likely consequences, containment, and corrective measures. Under the
   current LFPDPPP, notify affected people without delay when the confirmed
   breach significantly affects their patrimonial or moral rights. Do not apply
   GDPR's 72-hour supervisory-authority deadline to Mexico by analogy. If GDPR
   or a sector, title, contract, insurance policy, or authority-specific rule
   also applies, counsel must identify its recipient and clock.
6. **Preserve the legal decision and notification evidence** in the restricted
   incident system; do not put personal or privileged details in Git. See
   [`legal-regulatory-register.md`](legal-regulatory-register.md),
   `MX-PRIV-003`.

---

#### 🔴 TLS certificate expired

1. **Identify** via browser or `curl -vI https://your-fireisp.domain 2>&1 | grep "expire"`.
2. **Force Let's Encrypt renewal**:
   ```bash
   docker exec fireisp-certbot certbot renew --force-renewal
   docker exec fireisp-nginx nginx -s reload
   ```
4. If automated renewal is broken, check Certbot logs:
   ```bash
   docker logs fireisp-certbot --tail 50
   ```
5. Add a Prometheus alert for certificate expiry < 14 days (see `docs/slo.md`).

### Escalation Paths

```
On-call engineer  ──→  Engineering lead / CTO  ──→  All-hands bridge
   (0 – 15 min)           (15 – 30 min)              (> 30 min)

For legal/regulatory issues (data breach, SAT inquiry):
   On-call engineer  ──→  Legal/privacy counsel  ──→  Affected people and/or
                                                     competent authority only

                                                     order, title or contract
                                                     requires it, within its
                                                     actual deadline

For payment gateway issues:
   On-call engineer  ──→  Finance/accounting  ──→  Gateway support line
```

## AI Assistant

The AI Reply Assistant drafts (and optionally auto-sends) professional responses to
inbound support tickets. It is **per-organization** and can be toggled on or off
instantly without redeploying the application.

### Emergency kill switch

Use either method to halt all AI-generated replies immediately:

**Option A — API (fastest, scriptable):**

```bash
curl -X PUT https://<your-domain>/api/v1/ai/policy \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <admin-token>" \
  -H "X-Org-Id: <org_id>" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"enabled": false}'
```

**Option B — Admin UI:**

1. Log in as an admin user.
2. Navigate to **Settings → AI Assistant → General** tab.
3. Toggle the **Master switch** to **Off**.
4. Click **Save**.

Both actions take effect immediately for all new ticket replies; any reply that is
already being generated will still complete, but no further drafts will be
initiated.

### Re-enabling the assistant

```bash
curl -X PUT https://<your-domain>/api/v1/ai/policy \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <admin-token>" \
  -H "X-Org-Id: <org_id>" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"enabled": true}'
```

Or re-toggle the master switch in the admin UI (Settings → AI Assistant → General).

### Disabling a specific channel

To disable AI replies on a single channel (e.g., WhatsApp) while leaving others
active, update the `enabled_channels` map:

```bash
curl -X PUT https://<your-domain>/api/v1/ai/policy \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <admin-token>" \
  -H "X-Org-Id: <org_id>" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"enabled_channels": {"portal": true, "email": true, "whatsapp": false, "sms": true}}'
```

### Switching the active LLM provider

If the configured provider is failing or exhibiting unexpected behaviour, switch to
a backup provider:

```bash
# 1. List available providers to find the backup provider ID
curl https://<your-domain>/api/v1/ai/providers \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <admin-token>" \
  -H "X-Org-Id: <org_id>"

# 2. Set the active provider
curl -X PUT https://<your-domain>/api/v1/ai/policy \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <admin-token>" \
  -H "X-Org-Id: <org_id>" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"active_provider_id": <backup_provider_id>}'
```

### Checking recent AI reply logs

```sql
SELECT id, ticket_id, status, confidence, cost_usd, created_at
FROM ai_reply_logs
WHERE organization_id = <org_id>
ORDER BY created_at DESC
LIMIT 20;
```

Flag values for `status`: `draft`, `sent`, `discarded`, `error`.

### Diagnosing high LLM cost

```sql
SELECT
  DATE(created_at)        AS day,
  SUM(cost_usd)           AS total_usd,
  COUNT(*)                AS drafts,
  AVG(confidence)         AS avg_confidence
FROM ai_reply_logs
WHERE organization_id = <org_id>
  AND created_at >= DATE_SUB(NOW(), INTERVAL 30 DAY)
GROUP BY DATE(created_at)
ORDER BY day DESC;
```

If costs spike unexpectedly:

1. Check whether `mode` is set to `auto_send` (replies sent without human review).
2. Review `ai_reply_logs.prompt_hash` for repeated identical prompts (possible
   runaway retry loop).
3. Temporarily switch to a cheaper provider (e.g., a smaller Ollama model) while
   investigating.

### RAG / ChromaDB health check

If the optional RAG sidecar (`VECTOR_RETRIEVAL_ENABLED=true`) is enabled:

```bash
# Confirm the ChromaDB container is reachable
curl http://chromadb:8000/api/v1/heartbeat

# Start the sidecar if it is not running
docker compose --profile rag up -d chromadb
```

To trigger a full phrase-library re-embedding:

```bash
# Enqueue via the admin API
curl -X POST https://<your-domain>/api/v1/ai/backfill-embeddings \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <admin-token>" \
  -H "X-Org-Id: <org_id>"
```
