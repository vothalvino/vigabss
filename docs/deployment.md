## One-Line Installer (recommended)

The fastest way to deploy VigaBSS 5.0 on a fresh Ubuntu/Debian server:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vothalvino/fireisp5.0/main/install.sh | bash
```

The script will interactively prompt for your domain name and email address, then:

1. Verify Docker, Docker Compose v2, Git, and OpenSSL are present
2. Clone the repository to `/opt/fireisp`
3. Auto-generate strong random passwords and cryptographic secrets
4. Write `/opt/fireisp/.env.prod` (mode `600`) with all generated values
5. Obtain a TLS certificate via Let's Encrypt HTTP-01 challenge
6. Pull the published app image and start the full production stack (MySQL primary + replica, Redis, app, Nginx, Certbot)
7. Run database migrations (`node src/scripts/migrate.js`)
8. Seed default data — roles, permissions, settings, tax rates (`node src/scripts/seed.js`)

### Non-interactive (CI / cloud-init)

Pass all required values as environment variables to skip prompts:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vothalvino/fireisp5.0/main/install.sh \
  | DOMAIN=isp.example.com EMAIL=admin@example.com bash
```

### Installer options

| Variable | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `DOMAIN` | *(prompted)* | Public domain pointing to this server |
| `EMAIL` | *(prompted)* | Admin email — Let's Encrypt notifications + first login |
| `INSTALL_DIR` | `/opt/fireisp` | Destination directory |
| `SKIP_TLS` | `0` | Set to `1` to create a self-signed cert (dev / air-gapped) |
| `DB_PASSWORD` | *(auto-generated)* | MySQL app user password |
| `DB_ROOT_PASSWORD` | *(auto-generated)* | MySQL root password |
| `MYSQL_REPL_PASSWORD` | *(auto-generated)* | MySQL replication password |
| `REDIS_PASSWORD` | *(auto-generated)* | Redis password |
| `JWT_SECRET` | *(auto-generated)* | JWT signing secret (64 chars) |
| `ENCRYPTION_KEY` | *(auto-generated)* | AES-256 key for secrets at rest |

### After install

```bash
# View running services
docker compose -f /opt/fireisp/docker-compose.prod.yml --env-file /opt/fireisp/.env.prod ps

# Follow application logs
docker compose -f /opt/fireisp/docker-compose.prod.yml --env-file /opt/fireisp/.env.prod logs -f app

```

> **Note:** After install, open `https://<DOMAIN>` in your browser to create your admin account. Then configure SMTP in **Settings → Organization → Email** so notifications are delivered.

### Updating to a new version

For a standard redeploy, the repo ships **`redeploy.sh`** — it runs the whole
flow (pull `main` → pull the matching image → migrate → verify) as one command
and halts on the first failed step, so a rejected git pull or an image that CI
has not published yet never goes on to migrate against a stale container.

`install.sh` sets this up for you. To add it to an existing install, create a
**wrapper** (not a copy):

```bash
sudo tee /usr/local/bin/redeploy >/dev/null <<'EOF'
#!/usr/bin/env bash
exec env FIREISP_DIR=/opt/fireisp /opt/fireisp/redeploy.sh "$@"
EOF
sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/redeploy
```

then redeploy any time, from any directory:

```bash
sudo redeploy
```

> **Why a wrapper and not `install -m 0755 …`?** A copy goes stale the moment
> you `git pull`: you keep running the old script and get the old behaviour with
> nothing to indicate it. The wrapper always executes the version that shipped
> with the code you have. It also pins `FIREISP_DIR`, which cannot be left to
> the caller — `sudo` resets the environment, so `FIREISP_DIR=… sudo redeploy`
> is silently discarded. If you already installed a copy, replace it with the
> wrapper above.

> **Release note — payment webhooks now fail closed.** If you receive Stripe or
> Conekta webhooks, you **must** set `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET` / `CONEKTA_WEBHOOK_KEY`
> in your env before upgrading past this release. Previously an unset secret
> silently skipped signature verification (a forgery hole); now the receiver
> returns **503 `WEBHOOK_NOT_CONFIGURED`** instead of trusting the request. If you
> miss this, `/payment-webhooks/*` will 503 and invoices will stop auto-reconciling
> from payment callbacks — with no in-app alert, so check the provider's webhook
> dashboard or the app logs. Note the receiver reads the **env var**, not the
> per-gateway "Webhook Secret" field in Settings (that field is not yet wired to the
> receiver). `ALLOW_UNSIGNED_WEBHOOKS=true` re-enables the old unsigned behavior for
> local testing only — never set it in production.

For a non-standard install path, set `FIREISP_DIR` inside a root shell
(`sudo -i`) — as a `sudo` prefix it is stripped, see the rollback note below.

#### Nothing is compiled on the server

CI builds the image, scans it with Trivy, and publishes it to
`ghcr.io/vothalvino/fireisp5.0` — see `.github/workflows/ci.yml` → `container-scan`.
`redeploy` pulls that image. **The production host never runs a compiler.**

This is not a nicety. The in-image frontend build (`gen:api` + a whole-program
`tsc --noEmit` over 376 files + Vite with sourcemaps) peaks at roughly **1.43 GB
RSS**, and `up -d --build` ran it *while the whole stack was still resident*. On a
box whose floor already includes two 512 MB InnoDB buffer pools, the kernel
evicted cold pages into swap to make room. Because the database is small those
pages were never touched again, so swap ratcheted up with every deploy and never
drained — until the machine thrashed hard enough to lock out SSH and need a
reboot. A reboot zeroes swap, which is why it appeared to "fix" it, and why the
interval shrank as retained images grew the daemons' resident metadata.

`redeploy` pins the image to the **exact commit** it just checked out, so
`docker ps` and `git rev-parse HEAD` can never disagree. Rolling back is
therefore a tag change, not a rebuild — **pass the commit as an argument**:

```bash
sudo redeploy <older-commit-sha>
```

> Not `FIREISP_IMAGE_TAG=<sha> sudo redeploy`. `sudo` resets the environment by
> default (`Defaults env_reset`), so that prefix is **silently discarded** and
> the script falls through to `HEAD` — redeploying the newest build, i.e. the
> exact thing you were rolling back from, and exiting 0. An argument cannot be
> stripped. The same applies to `FIREISP_DIR`: set it inside a root shell
> (`sudo -i`) rather than as a `sudo` prefix.

**Rolling the image back does not roll the database back.** Migrations already
applied stay applied; `migrate.js` runs from inside the old image and no-ops,
because that image only knows its own already-applied files. Old code against a
forward schema is fine for additive migrations and breaks on a `DROP`, `RENAME`
or narrowed `ENUM` — check what the deploy you are undoing actually migrated.

If the pull fails, nothing on the host has changed and the previous containers
are still serving. Two causes worth telling apart:

- **`manifest unknown`** — no image for that commit. Usually CI hasn't finished
  (it publishes only *after* the scan passes). But note the `container-scan` job
  is deliberately allowed to go **green without building** when Docker Hub is
  unreachable, so on older commits a green tick is not proof an image exists —
  open the run and look for "Container scan SKIPPED". (Since this change, that
  case fails the branch on `main` rather than passing quietly.)
- **`denied` / `unauthorized`** — see the one-time package-visibility step below.

##### Upgrading from a build-on-the-server install

If `/usr/local/bin/redeploy` is a **copy** of the old script (the pre-wrapper
install form), it is still what runs after `git pull` — replace it with the
wrapper shown above, then deploy:

```bash
git -C /opt/fireisp pull
sudo tee /usr/local/bin/redeploy >/dev/null <<'EOF'
#!/usr/bin/env bash
exec env FIREISP_DIR=/opt/fireisp /opt/fireisp/redeploy.sh "$@"
EOF
sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/redeploy
sudo redeploy
```

Skipping that is not harmless: the old script runs `up -d --build`, finds no
`build:` block for `app`, and falls back to `${FIREISP_IMAGE:-…:latest}`. If CI
has not yet published the commit you just pulled, `:latest` is still the
*previous* one — so it succeeds while deploying older code against a newer
source tree.

##### Architecture

The image is published for **linux/amd64 and linux/arm64**, so Ampere, Graviton
and Hetzner CAX boxes pull it like anything else — `docker` picks the right one
automatically. CI builds each on a native runner rather than emulating arm64,
and `:latest` / `:<sha>` are only created once *both* have been built and
scanned, so a failure on one architecture never leaves the tag everyone pulls
pointing at a half-finished release.

Anything more exotic (32-bit ARM, RISC-V) has no published image; `install.sh`
detects that and builds from source instead.

##### One-time: make the image pullable

**A GitHub Container Registry package is PRIVATE by default, even when the
source repository is public.** The first CI run creates the package; until its
visibility is set, `docker compose pull` on the server fails with
`denied` / `unauthorized` and no amount of re-running will help.

Pick one:

**Public image (simplest).** On GitHub → your profile → **Packages** →
`fireisp5.0` → **Package settings** → **Change visibility** → Public. The
repository is already public and `.dockerignore` excludes `.env*`, so the image
contains nothing the source tree doesn't. Servers then pull anonymously with no
credentials to manage or rotate.

**Private image.** Keep it private and authenticate on each server with a
classic PAT scoped to `read:packages` only:

```bash
echo "$GHCR_PAT" | docker login ghcr.io -u <github-username> --password-stdin
```

Docker stores that in `/root/.docker/config.json`, so it survives reboots and
`redeploy` needs no change. Remember the PAT's expiry — when it lapses, deploys
start failing at the pull step, which (by design) leaves the running stack
untouched.

#### Verifying what is actually deployed

```bash
COMPOSE="docker compose -f /opt/fireisp/docker-compose.prod.yml --env-file /opt/fireisp/.env.prod"

# Which commit is the running container built from?
$COMPOSE images app

# The hashed bundle name changes whenever the frontend really changed.
curl -s https://<DOMAIN>/ | grep -o 'index-[^"]*\.js'
#    (optional) confirm a specific change shipped:
#    curl -s "https://<DOMAIN>/assets/<bundle>.js" | grep -c "<string from your change>"
```

> There is no longer any such thing as a stale cached frontend layer on the
> server, because the server does not build. If a merged change is not visible,
> the question is *which image tag is running* — not whether to force a rebuild.
> `--no-cache` is not the answer and no longer appears in these docs.

#### Building on the host anyway

Air-gapped, or testing an unmerged commit? Layer on the build override:

```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml -f docker-compose.build.yml --env-file .env.prod up -d --build
```

Do that on a machine with headroom. `FRONTEND_BUILD_HEAP_MB` (default 2048)
bounds V8's old space during the build so an oversized typecheck fails as a
clean heap OOM instead of taking the host down with it.

## Prerequisites

- **Node.js** 18+ (LTS recommended)
- **MySQL** 8.0+ or MariaDB 10.6+ with Event Scheduler enabled
- **RAM**: 2 GB minimum (4 GB recommended for >5,000 clients)
- **Disk**: 20 GB minimum (SSD recommended for SNMP metrics tables)

---

## Environment Configuration

Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and configure all values:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

### Critical Production Settings

```env
NODE_ENV=production
PORT=3000
APP_URL=https://isp.example.com

# IMPORTANT: Generate a strong random secret (64+ chars)
JWT_SECRET=$(openssl rand -base64 48)

DB_PASSWORD=<strong-password>
DB_NAME=fireisp

# SMTP (required for notifications)
SMTP_HOST=smtp.example.com
SMTP_PORT=587
SMTP_SECURE=false
SMTP_USER=noreply@example.com
SMTP_PASS=<smtp-password>
SMTP_FROM=noreply@example.com

# Logging
LOG_LEVEL=info
```

---

## Bare-Metal / VM Deployment

### 1. Install Node.js

```bash
curl -fsSL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_18.x | sudo -E bash -
sudo apt-get install -y nodejs
```

### 2. Install MySQL 8.4

```bash
sudo apt-get install -y mysql-server
sudo mysql_secure_installation
```

Enable Event Scheduler:

```sql
SET GLOBAL event_scheduler = ON;
```

Add to `/etc/mysql/mysql.conf.d/mysqld.cnf`:

```ini
[mysqld]
event_scheduler = ON
```

### 3. Create Database and User

```sql
CREATE DATABASE fireisp CHARACTER SET utf8mb4 COLLATE utf8mb4_unicode_ci;
CREATE USER 'fireisp'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY '<strong-password>';
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON fireisp.* TO 'fireisp'@'localhost';
FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
```

### 4. Deploy Application

```bash
# Clone or copy the application
cd /opt/fireisp

# Install production dependencies
npm ci --production

# Run migrations
npm run migrate

# Seed default data (roles, permissions, settings, tax rates)
# Only needed on first install
npm run seed

# Start the server
npm start
```

### 5. Run as a System Service (systemd)

Create `/etc/systemd/system/fireisp.service`:

```ini
[Unit]
Description=VigaBSS 5.0
After=network.target mysql.service

[Service]
Type=simple
User=fireisp
WorkingDirectory=/opt/fireisp
EnvironmentFile=/opt/fireisp/.env
ExecStart=/usr/bin/node src/server.js
Restart=on-failure
RestartSec=10

# Security hardening
NoNewPrivileges=true
ProtectSystem=strict
ProtectHome=true
ReadWritePaths=/opt/fireisp/storage

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

```bash
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl enable fireisp
sudo systemctl start fireisp
sudo journalctl -u fireisp -f  # View logs
```

---

## Docker Deployment

### Single-Node Docker Compose

```bash
# Configure environment
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with production values

# Start services
docker compose up -d

# Run migrations (first time only).
# NOTE: the production image strips npm, so call the script with `node` directly.
docker compose exec app node src/scripts/migrate.js

# Seed defaults (first time only)
docker compose exec app node src/scripts/seed.js

# View logs
docker compose logs -f app
```

### Updating

```bash
sudo redeploy            # pull main, pull the matching image, migrate, verify
```

Broken out, if you want the steps:

```bash
git pull
docker compose pull app                               # CI publishes; nothing builds here
docker compose up -d
docker compose exec app node src/scripts/migrate.js   # apply any new migrations
```

See **[Updating to a new version](#updating-to-a-new-version)** for why the
production host no longer compiles anything, how to roll back by tag, and how to
verify which image is actually running.

### Custom Dockerfile (production optimized)

The included `Dockerfile` is production-ready:
- Alpine base (minimal attack surface)
- Non-root user (`fireisp`)
- Health check built-in
- Production dependencies only

---

## Docker Swarm

For multi-node deployments:

```yaml
# docker-stack.yml
version: '3.8'

services:
  app:
    image: fireisp:5.0
    deploy:
      replicas: 2
      update_config:
        parallelism: 1
        delay: 30s
      restart_policy:
        condition: on-failure
    ports:
      - target: 3000
        published: 3000
        mode: host
    env_file:
      - .env
    healthcheck:
      test: ['CMD', 'wget', '-qO-', 'http://localhost:3000/health']
      interval: 30s
      timeout: 10s
      retries: 3

  db:
    image: mysql:8.4.9
    deploy:
      placement:
        constraints:
          - node.role == manager
    volumes:
      - db_data:/var/lib/mysql
    environment:
      MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD_FILE: /run/secrets/db_password
      MYSQL_DATABASE: fireisp
    secrets:
      - db_password
    command: >
      --event-scheduler=ON
      --character-set-server=utf8mb4
      --collation-server=utf8mb4_unicode_ci

secrets:
  db_password:
    external: true

volumes:
  db_data:
```

Deploy:

```bash
docker stack deploy -c docker-stack.yml fireisp
```

---

## MySQL Tuning

VigaBSS's SNMP metrics tables can grow to 155M+ rows. Recommended MySQL tuning for production:

```ini
[mysqld]
# InnoDB Buffer Pool — set to 50-70% of available RAM
innodb_buffer_pool_size = 2G

# Event Scheduler (REQUIRED for SNMP rollup + connection_logs)
event_scheduler = ON

# Transaction log
innodb_log_file_size = 256M
innodb_flush_log_at_trx_commit = 2  # 1 for max safety, 2 for performance

# Connection limits
max_connections = 200

# Query performance
innodb_io_capacity = 2000
innodb_io_capacity_max = 4000

# Partition maintenance (for snmp_metrics monthly partitions)
open_files_limit = 65535

# Binary logging for point-in-time recovery
log-bin = mysql-bin
binlog_expire_logs_seconds = 604800  # 7 days
server-id = 1

# Character set
character-set-server = utf8mb4
collation-server = utf8mb4_unicode_ci
```

### SNMP Metrics Scale Reference

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Devices polled | 6,000 |
| Poll interval | 5 minutes |
| Raw rows/day | ~1.73 million |
| Raw retention | 90 days (~155M rows) |
| Monthly partition size | ~52M rows |

---

## Reverse Proxy (Nginx)

### `/etc/nginx/sites-available/fireisp`

```nginx
upstream fireisp {
    server 127.0.0.1:3000;
    keepalive 32;
}

server {
    listen 443 ssl http2;
    server_name isp.example.com;

    ssl_certificate     /etc/letsencrypt/live/isp.example.com/fullchain.pem;
    ssl_certificate_key /etc/letsencrypt/live/isp.example.com/privkey.pem;

    # Security headers are set by the APP (Helmet, see src/app.js) — do not add
    # them here. nginx `add_header` appends to what the upstream already sent,
    # so repeating them puts two values on every response instead of overriding.

    # SSE support — disable buffering for event streams
    location /api/events/ {
        proxy_pass http://fireisp;
        proxy_http_version 1.1;
        proxy_set_header Connection "";
        proxy_buffering off;
        proxy_cache off;
        proxy_read_timeout 86400s;
    }

    # API and application
    location / {
        proxy_pass http://fireisp;
        proxy_http_version 1.1;
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;

        # File uploads (10MB max)
        client_max_body_size 10m;
    }

    # Metrics endpoint — restrict to internal networks
    location /metrics {
        allow 10.0.0.0/8;
        allow 172.16.0.0/12;
        allow 192.168.0.0/16;
        deny all;
        proxy_pass http://fireisp;
    }
}

server {
    listen 80;
    server_name isp.example.com;
    return 301 https://$host$request_uri;
}
```

---

## TLS / HTTPS

See **[docs/tls-setup.md](./tls-setup.md)** for the full TLS configuration
guide, including:

- **Let's Encrypt (HTTP-01)** — single-domain, automated via the Certbot
  Docker service + `nginx/init-letsencrypt.sh` bootstrap script.
- **Manual / commercial certificate** — drop `fullchain.pem` + `privkey.pem`
  into `./nginx/certs/` and reload nginx.

### Quick start (Let's Encrypt, HTTP-01)

```bash
chmod +x nginx/init-letsencrypt.sh
DOMAIN=isp.example.com EMAIL=admin@example.com ./nginx/init-letsencrypt.sh
docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml --env-file .env.prod up -d
```

Certificates renew automatically when within 30 days of expiry; nginx hot-reloads every 6
hours to pick them up.

---

## Admin IP Allowlist

VigaBSS can restrict access to sensitive admin endpoints to a set of trusted
IP addresses and/or CIDR ranges, providing an additional defence-in-depth
layer on top of JWT authentication and RBAC.

### Protected endpoints

When `ADMIN_IP_ALLOWLIST` is set, the following API routes require the
client IP to match:

| Route | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `/api/v1/organizations` | Organisation configuration |
| `/api/v1/users` | User management |
| `/api/v1/roles` | Role management |
| `/api/v1/settings` | System settings |
| `/api/v1/audit-logs` | Audit trail |
| `/api/v1/scheduled-tasks` | Scheduled task management |
| `/api/v1/import` | Bulk data import |
| `/api/v1/billing` | Billing cycle management |

### Configuration

Set `ADMIN_IP_ALLOWLIST` in `.env` to a comma-separated list of IPv4
addresses and/or CIDR blocks:

```env
# Allow a private management subnet and a specific jump-box IP
ADMIN_IP_ALLOWLIST=10.0.0.0/8,203.0.113.5

# Allow only a /24 management VLAN
# ADMIN_IP_ALLOWLIST=192.168.100.0/24
```

When `ADMIN_IP_ALLOWLIST` is **not set**, the feature is disabled and all
IPs are permitted (existing behaviour is preserved — the feature is opt-in).

### Rejected requests

Requests from unlisted IPs receive:

```json
{
  "error": {
    "code": "FORBIDDEN",
    "message": "Access denied: your IP address is not permitted to access this endpoint"
  }
}
```

### Behind a reverse proxy

If VigaBSS runs behind Nginx (or any other reverse proxy), make sure the
proxy sets `X-Forwarded-For` and that Express trusts the proxy:

```env
# Trust the first upstream proxy (Nginx)
# Set this in your .env if the app is behind a reverse proxy
TRUST_PROXY=1
```

Or call `app.set('trust proxy', 1)` in `src/app.js` when the deployment
topology requires it. Without this, `req.ip` will be the proxy's IP rather
than the real client IP, and the allowlist will not work as expected.

---

## Monitoring

### Health Check

```bash
curl https://isp.example.com/health
# {"status":"ok","version":"5.0.0","uptime":3600,"relay":"standalone","timestamp":"..."}

curl https://isp.example.com/health?detail=true
# Adds memory usage and DB latency
```

### Prometheus Metrics

VigaBSS exposes metrics at `/metrics` in Prometheus exposition format:

```yaml
# prometheus.yml
scrape_configs:
  - job_name: fireisp
    static_configs:
      - targets: ['isp.example.com:3000']
    metrics_path: /metrics
    scrape_interval: 15s
```

Available metrics:
- `process_uptime_seconds` — Process uptime
- `process_resident_memory_bytes` — RSS memory
- `http_requests_total` — Total HTTP requests
- `http_request_errors_total` — HTTP 4xx/5xx errors
- `http_request_duration_seconds` — Request latency histogram

## Kubernetes Deployment

Kubernetes provides automatic scaling, self-healing, and declarative configuration for VigaBSS 5.0.

### ConfigMap

Store non-secret configuration in a ConfigMap:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: fireisp-config
  namespace: fireisp
data:
  NODE_ENV: "production"
  PORT: "3000"
  APP_URL: "https://isp.example.com"
  DB_HOST: "mysql-primary.fireisp.svc.cluster.local"
  DB_PORT: "3306"
  DB_NAME: "fireisp"
  DB_USER: "fireisp"
  DB_POOL_SIZE: "10"
  SMTP_HOST: "smtp.example.com"
  SMTP_PORT: "587"
  SMTP_SECURE: "false"
  SMTP_FROM: "noreply@example.com"
  LOG_LEVEL: "info"
  REDIS_URL: "redis://redis.fireisp.svc.cluster.local:6379"
```

### Secret

Store sensitive values in a Kubernetes Secret (base64-encoded):

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret

                port:
                  name: http
```

### PersistentVolumeClaim

The `storage/` directory holds uploaded files and must persist across pod restarts:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
metadata:
  name: fireisp-storage
  namespace: fireisp
spec:
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteMany
  storageClassName: nfs
  resources:
    requests:
      storage: 20Gi
```

> **Note:** Use a `ReadWriteMany` access mode (e.g., NFS or a cloud file share) when running multiple replicas so all pods can access the same storage volume.

### Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA)

```yaml
apiVersion: autoscaling/v2
kind: HorizontalPodAutoscaler
metadata:
  name: fireisp
  namespace: fireisp
spec:
  scaleTargetRef:
    apiVersion: apps/v1
    kind: Deployment
    name: fireisp
  minReplicas: 2
  maxReplicas: 10
  metrics:
    - type: Resource
      resource:
        name: cpu
        target:
          type: Utilization
          averageUtilization: 70
    - type: Resource
      resource:
        name: memory
        target:
          type: Utilization
          averageUtilization: 80
```

> **Tip:** Start with CPU-based scaling and add memory metrics if your workload is memory-intensive. Monitor actual utilization for a few days before tuning thresholds.

---

## Database Replication

For high availability and read scaling, configure MySQL replication.

### Primary-Replica Setup

1. **Primary** handles all writes (INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE) and schema migrations.
2. **Replicas** handle read traffic (SELECT queries for dashboards, reports, SNMP metrics).

On the primary, enable binary logging in `/etc/mysql/mysql.conf.d/mysqld.cnf`:

```ini
[mysqld]
server-id = 1
log_bin = /var/log/mysql/mysql-bin.log
binlog_format = ROW
gtid_mode = ON
enforce_gtid_consistency = ON
```

On each replica:

```ini
[mysqld]
server-id = 2
relay_log = /var/log/mysql/mysql-relay-bin.log
read_only = ON
gtid_mode = ON
enforce_gtid_consistency = ON
```

Start replication on the replica:

```sql
CHANGE REPLICATION SOURCE TO
  SOURCE_HOST='primary.db.example.com',
  SOURCE_USER='repl_user',
  SOURCE_PASSWORD='<replication-password>',
  SOURCE_AUTO_POSITION=1;
START REPLICA;
```

### MySQL Group Replication / InnoDB Cluster

For automatic failover, consider MySQL InnoDB Cluster:

- **MySQL Shell** for cluster administration
- **MySQL Router** for transparent connection routing
- Minimum 3 nodes for fault tolerance

```bash
# Bootstrap MySQL Router to auto-discover the cluster
mysqlrouter --bootstrap root@primary:3306 --directory /etc/mysqlrouter
```

### Connection String Configuration

Configure read replicas in your environment:

```env
# Primary (read-write)
DB_HOST=primary.db.example.com
DB_PORT=3306

# Read replica (optional — used for reporting and dashboards)
DB_READ_HOST=replica.db.example.com
DB_READ_PORT=3306
```

When using MySQL Router:

```env
# MySQL Router ports (read-write and read-only)
DB_HOST=127.0.0.1
DB_PORT=6446
DB_READ_HOST=127.0.0.1
DB_READ_PORT=6447
```

### Event Scheduler

> **Important:** The MySQL Event Scheduler must run on the **primary** node only. Replicas replicate scheduled event results via binlog — do not enable `event_scheduler = ON` on replicas.

```ini
# Primary only
[mysqld]
event_scheduler = ON
```

### Backup Strategy with Replica

Take backups from a replica to avoid impacting production traffic:

```bash
# Full backup from replica using mysqldump
mysqldump -h replica.db.example.com -u backup_user -p \
  --single-transaction --routines --events --triggers \
  fireisp > fireisp_backup_$(date +%Y%m%d).sql

# Or use Percona XtraBackup for large databases
xtrabackup --backup --target-dir=/backups/full \
  --host=replica.db.example.com --user=backup_user --password=<password>
```

Schedule daily backups via cron:

```bash
0 2 * * * /opt/fireisp/scripts/backup.sh >> /var/log/fireisp-backup.log 2>&1
```

---

## Redis High Availability

Redis is used for session caching, rate limiting, and BullMQ job queues. In production, deploy Redis with high availability.

### Redis Sentinel

Redis Sentinel provides automatic failover with a primary and multiple replicas:

1. Run at least **3 Sentinel instances** for quorum.
2. Sentinels monitor the primary and promote a replica on failure.

Example Sentinel configuration (`sentinel.conf`):

```conf
sentinel monitor fireisp-redis primary.redis.example.com 6379 2
sentinel down-after-milliseconds fireisp-redis 5000
sentinel failover-timeout fireisp-redis 10000
sentinel parallel-syncs fireisp-redis 1
sentinel auth-pass fireisp-redis <redis-password>
```

Configure the application to use Sentinel. With `ioredis` (used by BullMQ), provide Sentinel configuration via environment variables:

```env
REDIS_SENTINELS=sentinel1:26379,sentinel2:26379,sentinel3:26379
REDIS_SENTINEL_NAME=fireisp-redis
REDIS_DB=0
```

If your Redis client library supports a Sentinel URL scheme, the format is:

```env
REDIS_URL=redis+sentinel://sentinel1:26379,sentinel2:26379,sentinel3:26379/fireisp-redis/0
```

> **Note:** The `redis+sentinel://` URL scheme is not universally supported. Check your client library's documentation. `ioredis` uses a structured `sentinels` option rather than a URL string.

### Redis Cluster

For horizontal scaling beyond a single node's memory capacity:

- Data is automatically sharded across multiple masters.
- Each master has one or more replicas for failover.
- Minimum 6 nodes (3 masters + 3 replicas).

```bash
redis-cli --cluster create \
  redis1:6379 redis2:6379 redis3:6379 \
  redis4:6379 redis5:6379 redis6:6379 \
  --cluster-replicas 1
```

### Session and Cache Invalidation

When scaling Redis:

- **Sessions (JWT):** VigaBSS uses stateless JWTs — no server-side session store is required. Token revocation lists (if enabled) are stored in Redis and must be accessible from all app instances.
- **Cache:** Cached data (plan lookups, permission sets) is stored per-key in Redis. All app nodes share the same cache, so invalidation is automatic.
- **BullMQ:** Job queues require a single Redis instance or Sentinel — Redis Cluster is not natively supported by BullMQ. Use a dedicated Redis Sentinel deployment for job queues if you use Redis Cluster for caching.

---

## Load Balancing

Distribute traffic across multiple VigaBSS instances for high availability and throughput.

### Nginx Upstream Configuration

```nginx
upstream fireisp_backend {
    least_conn;
    server 10.0.1.10:3000;
    server 10.0.1.11:3000;
    server 10.0.1.12:3000;
}

server {
    listen 443 ssl http2;
    server_name isp.example.com;

    ssl_certificate     /etc/ssl/certs/fireisp.crt;
    ssl_certificate_key /etc/ssl/private/fireisp.key;

    location / {
        proxy_pass http://fireisp_backend;
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
    }

    # SSE endpoints need long-lived connections
    location /api/events {
        proxy_pass http://fireisp_backend;
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
        proxy_buffering off;
        proxy_cache off;
        proxy_read_timeout 3600s;
        proxy_send_timeout 3600s;
    }
}
```

### Sticky Sessions

Sticky sessions (session affinity) are **not required**. VigaBSS uses stateless JWT authentication — any backend instance can handle any request. Use `least_conn` or `round_robin` balancing for even distribution.

### WebSocket / SSE Considerations

VigaBSS uses **Server-Sent Events (SSE)** for real-time updates:

- SSE connections are long-lived HTTP connections (minutes to hours).
- Configure `proxy_read_timeout` to a high value (e.g., `3600s`) for SSE endpoints.
- Ensure the load balancer does not prematurely close idle connections.
- Set `proxy_buffering off` so events are delivered immediately.

### Health Check Configuration

Configure active health checks in Nginx (requires `nginx-plus` or the open-source `nginx_upstream_check_module`):

```nginx
upstream fireisp_backend {
    least_conn;
    server 10.0.1.10:3000 max_fails=3 fail_timeout=30s;
    server 10.0.1.11:3000 max_fails=3 fail_timeout=30s;
    server 10.0.1.12:3000 max_fails=3 fail_timeout=30s;
}
```

With Nginx open-source, passive health checks are used by default — failed requests trigger `max_fails` and temporarily remove the upstream. For active checks, use the `/health/ready` endpoint in your load balancer or orchestrator.

---

## Blue-Green Deployment Strategy

Blue-green deployments minimize downtime and risk by running two identical environments.

### Overview

1. **Blue** — the current live environment serving production traffic.
2. **Green** — the new version deployed alongside Blue, not yet receiving traffic.

### Database Migration Compatibility

Migrations must be **forward-only and additive**:

- Add new columns with default values — never remove or rename columns in the same release.
- Add new tables freely.
- Defer destructive changes (column drops, renames) to a follow-up release after the old version is fully retired.

This ensures both Blue and Green can operate against the same database simultaneously.

Run migrations before switching traffic:

```bash
# Deploy Green and run migrations
cd /opt/fireisp-green
npm run migrate
```

### Traffic Switching with Nginx

```nginx
upstream fireisp_blue {
    server 10.0.1.10:3000;
    server 10.0.1.11:3000;
}

upstream fireisp_green {
    server 10.0.2.10:3000;
    server 10.0.2.11:3000;
}

server {
    listen 443 ssl http2;
    server_name isp.example.com;

    # Switch traffic: edit this line to point to the desired upstream group
    # (fireisp_blue or fireisp_green), then reload Nginx with:
    #   sudo nginx -t && sudo systemctl reload nginx
    set $backend fireisp_green;

    location / {
        proxy_pass http://$backend;
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
    }
}
```

Reload Nginx to apply:

```bash
sudo nginx -t && sudo systemctl reload nginx
```

### Traffic Switching with Kubernetes

Update the Service selector to point to the green Deployment:

```bash
kubectl set selector service/fireisp -n fireisp app=fireisp,version=green
```

### Rollback Procedure

1. Switch traffic back to Blue (change `$backend` to `fireisp_blue` in Nginx, or update the Kubernetes service selector).
2. Reload the load balancer or apply the selector change.
3. Investigate the issue in the Green environment.
4. If a database migration was applied, deploy a compensating migration — never roll back migrations manually.

### Smoke Test Checklist

Run these checks against the Green environment before switching traffic:

- [ ] `/health/ready` returns `200 OK`
- [ ] Login and JWT issuance works
- [ ] Dashboard loads with correct data
- [ ] Client creation and editing works
- [ ] RADIUS authentication succeeds (test with `radtest`)
- [ ] SNMP polling returns metrics
- [ ] Email notifications send successfully
- [ ] Background jobs (BullMQ) are processing
- [ ] No errors in application logs (`kubectl logs` or `journalctl`)

## Scaling Considerations

### Horizontal Scaling

VigaBSS 5.0 is designed as a **stateless application** — any instance can serve any request. Scale horizontally by adding more app server instances behind a load balancer.

Requirements for horizontal scaling:

- **Shared database:** All instances connect to the same MySQL primary.
- **Shared Redis:** All instances connect to the same Redis for cache, rate limiting, and job queues.
- **Shared storage:** The `storage/` directory must be accessible from all instances (use NFS, cloud file storage, or S3-compatible object storage).

### FireRelay Mode

For multi-node deployments, enable **FireRelay** to synchronize real-time events across instances:

```env
FIRERELAY_ENABLED=true
FIRERELAY_TRANSPORT=redis
REDIS_URL=redis://redis.example.com:6379
```

FireRelay uses Redis Pub/Sub to broadcast events (e.g., client disconnections, CoA pushes) to all connected instances, ensuring SSE clients on any node receive updates.

### Database Connection Pool Sizing

Each VigaBSS instance maintains a connection pool to MySQL. Size it based on your instance count and MySQL `max_connections`:

```env
DB_POOL_SIZE=10
```

**Rule of thumb:** `DB_POOL_SIZE × number_of_instances` should not exceed 80% of MySQL's `max_connections`.

```sql
-- Check current MySQL max connections
SHOW VARIABLES LIKE 'max_connections';

-- Example: 3 instances × 10 pool size = 30 connections
-- MySQL max_connections should be at least 40 (30 + headroom)
SET GLOBAL max_connections = 150;
```

### Redis for Session and Cache

When running multiple instances, Redis is required for:

- **Rate limiting:** Shared counters across instances.
- **Cache:** Avoid stale data when one instance invalidates a cache entry.
- **Token revocation:** Revoked JWTs must be checked across all instances.

```env
REDIS_URL=redis://redis.example.com:6379
CACHE_DRIVER=redis
RATE_LIMIT_STORE=redis
```

### Job Queue (BullMQ)

Background tasks (email sending, SNMP polling, invoice generation) are distributed via BullMQ:

- BullMQ uses Redis as its backing store.
- Jobs are automatically distributed — only one instance processes each job.
- Scale workers independently by running dedicated worker processes:

```bash
# Run a dedicated worker process (does not serve HTTP)
node src/workers/index.js
```

Configure concurrency per worker:

```env
BULLMQ_CONCURRENCY=5
```

> **Tip:** For large deployments (10,000+ clients), run separate worker processes dedicated to SNMP polling and invoice generation to avoid blocking lighter tasks like email delivery.

## Helm Chart Deployment

VigaBSS 5.0 ships a production-grade Helm chart under `charts/fireisp/` that
templates every Kubernetes resource (Namespace, ConfigMap, Secret, Deployment,
Service, Ingress, HPA, PDB, PVC, PrometheusRule, and ClusterImagePolicy).

### Prerequisites

- Helm 3.12+
- Kubernetes 1.27+
- (Optional) [cert-manager](https://cert-manager.io/) for TLS
- (Optional) [Prometheus Operator](https://github.com/prometheus-operator/prometheus-operator) for alerting rules
- (Optional) [Sigstore policy-controller](https://github.com/sigstore/policy-controller) for image verification

### Quick Start

```bash
# Add the chart repo (GitHub Pages — populated by chart-releaser CI)
helm repo add fireisp https://vothalvino.github.io/fireisp5.0
helm repo update

# Install into the fireisp namespace (creates namespace automatically)
helm install fireisp fireisp/fireisp \
  --namespace fireisp --create-namespace \
  --set ingress.hostname=isp.example.com \
  --set secrets.JWT_SECRET="$(openssl rand -base64 48)" \
  --set secrets.ENCRYPTION_KEY="$(openssl rand -hex 32)" \
  --set secrets.DB_HOST=mysql.fireisp.svc.cluster.local \
  --set secrets.DB_PASSWORD=my-db-password
```

> **Production secret management:** Do not pass secrets via `--set` in CI
> pipelines. Use Sealed Secrets or External Secrets Operator instead —
> see [docs/secrets-management.md](./secrets-management.md).

### Installing from Source

```bash
cd charts/fireisp
helm dependency update          # no external dependencies currently
helm install fireisp . \
  --namespace fireisp --create-namespace \
  -f my-values.yaml
```

### values.yaml Overrides

Create a `my-values.yaml` that overrides only what you need:

```yaml
replicaCount: 3

image:
  repository: ghcr.io/vothalvino/fireisp5.0
  tag: "5.0.0"

ingress:
  hostname: isp.example.com
  tls:
    enabled: true
    clusterIssuer: letsencrypt-prod   # cert-manager ClusterIssuer name

config:
  LOG_LEVEL: "info"
  FEATURE_SSO: "true"

secrets:
  JWT_SECRET: ""          # populated by Sealed Secret / ESO
  ENCRYPTION_KEY: ""
  DB_HOST: mysql-primary.fireisp.svc.cluster.local
  DB_PASSWORD: ""

persistence:
  size: 50Gi
  storageClassName: gp3

monitoring:
  enabled: true           # requires Prometheus Operator CRDs

cosignPolicy:
  enabled: true           # requires sigstore policy-controller CRDs
```

### Running Migrations

Run migrations once after the first install (or after upgrading):

```bash
kubectl exec -n fireisp deploy/fireisp -- node src/scripts/migrate.js
```

### Upgrading

```bash
helm upgrade fireisp fireisp/fireisp \
  --namespace fireisp \
  -f my-values.yaml \
  --set image.tag=5.1.0
```

### Uninstalling

```bash
helm uninstall fireisp --namespace fireisp
# The PVC is NOT deleted by default (Helm preserves PVCs by default). The
# Secret also has helm.sh/resource-policy: keep — delete both manually if
# doing a full teardown.
kubectl delete pvc -n fireisp fireisp-storage
```

---

## GitOps with Argo CD

[Argo CD](https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/) can continuously reconcile the
Helm chart against your cluster, giving you automated drift detection and
one-click rollbacks.

### Install Argo CD

```bash
kubectl create namespace argocd
kubectl apply -n argocd \
  -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/argoproj/argo-cd/stable/manifests/install.yaml
```

### Argo CD Application Manifest

Create `gitops/fireisp-app.yaml` and commit it to your GitOps repository:

```yaml
apiVersion: argoproj.io/v1alpha1
kind: Application
metadata:
  name: fireisp
  namespace: argocd
  # Cascade delete: removing this Application also removes the K8s resources.
  finalizers:
    - resources-finalizer.argocd.argoproj.io
spec:
  project: default

  source:
    repoURL: https://github.com/vothalvino/fireisp5.0
    targetRevision: main          # or a tag, e.g. v5.0.0
    path: charts/fireisp
    helm:
      valueFiles:
        - values.yaml
        # Override with environment-specific values committed to the repo:
        - values-production.yaml
      # Fine-grained overrides (avoid plain-text secrets here):
      parameters:
        - name: image.tag
          value: "5.0.0"
        - name: ingress.hostname
          value: isp.example.com
        - name: ingress.tls.enabled
          value: "true"
        - name: ingress.tls.clusterIssuer
          value: letsencrypt-prod
        - name: monitoring.enabled
          value: "true"

  destination:
    server: https://kubernetes.default.svc
    namespace: fireisp

  syncPolicy:
    automated:
      prune: true         # remove resources deleted from the chart
      selfHeal: true      # revert manual kubectl changes
    syncOptions:
      - CreateNamespace=true
      - ServerSideApply=true
    retry:
      limit: 5
      backoff:
        duration: 5s
        factor: 2
        maxDuration: 3m
```

Apply the Application to Argo CD:

```bash
kubectl apply -f gitops/fireisp-app.yaml
# Open the Argo CD UI to watch the sync:
kubectl port-forward svc/argocd-server -n argocd 8080:443
# https://localhost:8080 — default credentials: admin / <initial-password>
argocd admin initial-password -n argocd
```

### Secrets with Argo CD + Sealed Secrets

Combine Argo CD with [Sealed Secrets](https://github.com/bitnami-labs/sealed-secrets)
so encrypted secret manifests can be committed safely to git:

```bash
# Seal the fireisp-secret for the fireisp namespace
kubectl create secret generic fireisp-secret \
  --namespace fireisp \
  --dry-run=client \
  --from-literal=JWT_SECRET="$(openssl rand -base64 48)" \
  --from-literal=ENCRYPTION_KEY="$(openssl rand -hex 32)" \
  --from-literal=DB_PASSWORD="my-password" \
  -o yaml \
  | kubeseal --format yaml > gitops/fireisp-sealed-secret.yaml

git add gitops/fireisp-sealed-secret.yaml
git commit -m "chore: rotate fireisp secrets"
git push
# Argo CD will automatically apply the SealedSecret and Sealed Secrets
# controller will decrypt it into a regular Secret inside the cluster.
```

See [docs/secrets-management.md](./secrets-management.md) for the full
Sealed Secrets workflow and other secret-backend options (ESO / Vault).

### Chart Release Workflow

The CI pipeline (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) includes a `helm-release` job
that runs on every push of a version tag (`v*.*.*`):

1. Packages the chart with `helm package charts/fireisp`.
2. Uploads the packaged chart to the `gh-pages` branch via
   [`helm/chart-releaser-action`](https://github.com/helm/chart-releaser-action).

```bash
git tag v5.1.0
git push origin v5.1.0
```
