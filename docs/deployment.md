# Deployment Guide

This guide covers deploying VigaBSS 0.1.0-alpha.1 in production environments. Choose the deployment method that best fits your infrastructure.

> **Alpha release:** validate restore, upgrade, billing, and device automation
> against a non-production deployment before serving customers.

### Existing FireISP-era installations

The VigaBSS defaults below are for fresh installs. An existing installation at
`/opt/fireisp`, with a `fireisp` Compose project/database/volume set or
`FIREISP_*` environment settings, remains supported. Do **not** rename a live
database, Docker volume, Compose project, WireGuard interface, or install
directory merely for branding. The deployment scripts accept the legacy names
as compatibility aliases; keep using the identifiers already attached to your
data and pass that installation's path explicitly when needed.

## One-Line Installer (recommended)

The fastest way to deploy VigaBSS 0.1.0-alpha.1 on a fresh Ubuntu/Debian server:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vothalvino/vigabss/main/install.sh | bash
```

The script will interactively prompt for your domain name and email address, then:

1. Install missing Docker, Docker Compose v2, Git, and OpenSSL dependencies on Ubuntu/Debian (or verify they are present on another distribution)
2. Clone the repository to `/opt/vigabss`
3. Auto-generate strong random passwords and cryptographic secrets
4. Write `/opt/vigabss/.env.prod` (mode `600`) with all generated values
5. Obtain a TLS certificate via Let's Encrypt HTTP-01 challenge
6. Pull the published app image and start the full production stack (MySQL primary + replica, Redis, app, Nginx, Certbot)
7. Run database migrations (`node src/scripts/migrate.js`)
8. Seed default data — roles, permissions, settings, tax rates (`node src/scripts/seed.js`)

### Non-interactive (CI / cloud-init)

Pass all required values as environment variables to skip prompts:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vothalvino/vigabss/main/install.sh \
  | DOMAIN=isp.example.com EMAIL=admin@example.com bash
```

### Installer options

| Variable | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `DOMAIN` | *(prompted)* | Public domain pointing to this server |
| `EMAIL` | *(prompted)* | Admin email — Let's Encrypt notifications + first login |
| `INSTALL_DIR` | `/opt/vigabss` | Destination directory |
| `SKIP_TLS` | `0` | Set to `1` to create a self-signed cert (dev / air-gapped) |
| `DB_PASSWORD` | *(auto-generated)* | MySQL app user password |
| `DB_ROOT_PASSWORD` | *(auto-generated)* | MySQL root password |
| `MYSQL_REPL_PASSWORD` | *(auto-generated)* | MySQL replication password |
| `REDIS_PASSWORD` | *(auto-generated)* | Redis password |
| `JWT_SECRET` | *(auto-generated)* | JWT signing secret (64 chars) |
| `ENCRYPTION_KEY` | *(auto-generated)* | AES-256 key for secrets at rest |
| `WG_LISTEN_PORT` | *(random high port)* | NAS WireGuard UDP port on a fresh install |
| `WG_CLIENT_LISTEN_PORT` | *(random high port)* | Technician/client WireGuard UDP port on a fresh install |

### After install

```bash
# View running services
docker compose -f /opt/vigabss/docker-compose.prod.yml --env-file /opt/vigabss/.env.prod ps

# Follow application logs
docker compose -f /opt/vigabss/docker-compose.prod.yml --env-file /opt/vigabss/.env.prod logs -f app

```

> **Note:** After install, open `https://<DOMAIN>` and sign in with the initial
> administrator credentials printed by the installer. Change that password,
> then configure SMTP in **Settings → Organization → Email** so notifications
> are delivered.

### Updating to a new version

For a standard redeploy, the repo ships **`redeploy.sh`** — it runs the whole
flow (pull `main` → pull the matching image → migrate with a non-listening
one-off container → start → verify `/health/ready`) as one command and halts on
the first failed step. It gracefully stops the previous app before migration,
then starts the new image's HTTP/RADIUS/SNMP listeners only after migrations
succeed. This creates a short, explicit maintenance window. If migration fails,
the previous app deliberately remains stopped because restarting legacy code
against a partially tightened schema could reintroduce credentials or unsafe
audit data; fix or roll forward the migration and rerun `redeploy`.

`install.sh` sets this up for you. To add it to an existing install, create a
**wrapper** (not a copy):

```bash
sudo tee /usr/local/bin/redeploy >/dev/null <<'EOF'
#!/usr/bin/env bash
exec env VIGABSS_DIR=/opt/vigabss /opt/vigabss/redeploy.sh "$@"
EOF
sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/redeploy
```

then redeploy any time, from any directory:

```bash
sudo redeploy
```

> **Why a wrapper and not `install -m 0755 …`?** A copy goes stale the moment
> you `git pull`: you keep running the old script and get the old behaviour with
> nothing to indicate it. The wrapper always executes the version that shipped
> with the code you have. It also pins `VIGABSS_DIR`, which cannot be left to
> the caller — `sudo` resets the environment, so `VIGABSS_DIR=… sudo redeploy`
> is silently discarded. If you already installed a copy, replace it with the
> wrapper above.

Helm and the plain `k8s/` Deployment use the `Recreate` strategy so all old pods
drain before a new-image init container runs the same migration command. The
application container cannot bind HTTP, RADIUS, or SNMP UDP until migration
succeeds. Concurrent init attempts are additionally serialized through a
database advisory lock.
The official Compose, Helm, and plain-Kubernetes paths migrate every active
isolated tenant database by default. If a custom deployment deliberately turns
that fan-out off, it must migrate and verify those databases separately before
starting the new image; schema-dependent features fail closed rather than
falling back to the shared primary database.

> **Release note — payment webhooks now fail closed.** If you receive Stripe or
> Conekta webhooks, you **must** set `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET` / `CONEKTA_WEBHOOK_KEY`
> in your env before upgrading past this release. Previously an unset secret
> silently skipped signature verification (a forgery hole); now the receiver
> returns **503 `WEBHOOK_NOT_CONFIGURED`** instead of trusting the request. If you
> miss this, `/payment-webhooks/*` will 503 and invoices will stop auto-reconciling
> from payment callbacks — with no in-app alert, so check the provider's webhook
> dashboard or the app logs. Note the receiver reads the **env var**, not the
> per-gateway "Webhook Secret" field in Settings (that field is not yet wired to the
> receiver). `ALLOW_UNSIGNED_WEBHOOKS=true` re-enables the old unsigned behavior only
> when `NODE_ENV` is explicitly `development` or `test`; deployed environments ignore
> the flag and continue to fail closed.

For a non-standard install path, set `VIGABSS_DIR` inside a root shell
(`sudo -i`) — as a `sudo` prefix it is stripped, see the rollback note below.

#### Nothing is compiled on the server

CI builds the image, scans it with Trivy, and publishes it to
`ghcr.io/vothalvino/vigabss` — see `.github/workflows/ci.yml` → `container-scan`.
`redeploy` pulls that image. **The production host never runs a compiler.**

This is not a nicety. The in-image frontend build (`gen:api` + a whole-program
`tsc --noEmit` over 376 files + Vite with sourcemaps) peaks at roughly **1.43 GB
RSS**, and `up -d --build` ran it *while the whole stack was still resident*. On a
box whose floor already includes two 512 MB InnoDB buffer pools, the kernel
evicted cold pages into swap to make room. Because the database is small those
pages were never touched again, so swap ratcheted up with every deploy and never
drained — until the machine thrashed hard enough to lock out SSH and need a
reboot. A reboot zeroes swap, which is why it appeared to "fix" it, and why the
interval shrank as retained images grew the daemons' resident metadata.

`redeploy` pins the image to the **exact commit** it just checked out, so
`docker ps` and `git rev-parse HEAD` can never disagree. Rolling back is
therefore a tag change, not a rebuild — **pass the commit as an argument**:

```bash
sudo redeploy <older-commit-sha>
```

> Not `VIGABSS_IMAGE_TAG=<sha> sudo redeploy`. `sudo` resets the environment by
> default (`Defaults env_reset`), so that prefix is **silently discarded** and
> the script falls through to `HEAD` — redeploying the newest build, i.e. the
> exact thing you were rolling back from, and exiting 0. An argument cannot be
> stripped. The same applies to `VIGABSS_DIR`: set it inside a root shell
> (`sudo -i`) rather than as a `sudo` prefix.

**Rolling the image back does not roll the database back.** Migrations already
applied stay applied; `migrate.js` runs from inside the old image and no-ops,
because that image only knows its own already-applied files. Old code against a
forward schema is fine for additive migrations and breaks on a `DROP`, `RENAME`
or narrowed `ENUM` — check what the deploy you are undoing actually migrated.

Migration 459 is an explicit one-way application compatibility boundary.
`redeploy` refuses any target commit that predates it: an older image would use
the new AES-GCM webhook envelope as an HMAC key and could persist SNMP
communities or sensitive legacy audit values again. Roll forward with a fixed
post-459 image. Going further back requires a separately rehearsed, approved
full application-and-database restore from a pre-459 backup, not the normal
one-command image rollback.

Migration 460 is likewise a one-way client-communication privacy boundary.
It withdraws legacy marketing grants, discards malformed/plaintext SMTP
credentials, and teaches queues to enforce client contact epochs, organization
lifecycle epochs, and server-owned message classes. `redeploy` refuses a target
that predates migration 460 because old workers would ignore those controls.
Stop and drain every old HTTP process and outbound worker, migrate the primary
and every retained isolated database with `MIGRATE_ISOLATED_TENANTS=true`, then
start only the new image. Recover by rolling forward to another post-460 image;
going pre-460 requires a rehearsed full application-and-database restore.

#### Installation consent/signing upgrade (migration 451)

Migration 451 intentionally fails closed for Mexican installation contracts.
After upgrading, any existing active `activation_contract` document template
must be linked to the organization-owned registered source whose text matches it
exactly. In the admin UI, record the external registration evidence under
**Regulatory Compliance → Consumer Protection**, then select that registered
source under **Document Templates**. New or pending MX installations will not
start until this is complete. Global organizations do not use the Mexican
registry and automatically receive the neutral service-installation
acknowledgment.

Do not manufacture or auto-backfill a registration link: the registration
number, date, status, and exact registered text are operator-supplied evidence
of an external authority process. VigaBSS validates and freezes that evidence;
it does not register or legally approve the contract.

Treat rollback 451 as evidence-destructive after this flow has gone live. It
removes registration snapshots, signature-envelope hashes, communication
choices, and consent provenance columns. Take a database backup and export any
required evidence before running that rollback; rolling the application image
back does not require rolling this additive database migration back.

#### MX contract sandbox/production upgrade (migration 452)

Migration 452 adds an independent environment selector for Mexican adhesion
contracts. This selector is separate from the PAC/CFDI environment: an ISP may
test contract onboarding while issuing real CFDIs, or test CFDIs while using
its real registered contract.

The contract **sandbox is a VigaBSS simulation only**. It is not a PROFECO
sandbox, registration service, approval, or legal contract. Sandbox sources:

- use `sandbox_ready` rather than `registered`;
- cannot contain an official registration number or registration date;
- are permanently marked as test/no-legal-effect in the rendered signing
  evidence; and
- can never be promoted or relabeled as production evidence.

Prepare a separate production source with the exact externally registered text,
real registration number, and date, then link an active production document
template before switching the organization to production. The switch applies
only to new contracts. It refuses to move while installations are in progress
or while a live sandbox contract remains, and it never rewrites existing
contracts, documents, or signatures.

Existing pre-452 MX registry sources are preserved in the production lane. An
otherwise unconfigured MX organization starts in sandbox. The environment of
every new MX contract and signed document is frozen with its source so a later
organization switch cannot change historical provenance.

Rollback 452 intentionally refuses to run after v3 signing evidence exists or
after a sandbox source has been linked into operational/history records. Roll
the application image back without rolling back this additive migration, or
export and migrate that evidence through a deliberate recovery procedure.

#### New settings arrive on their own

`redeploy` appends any **managed setting** your `.env.prod` does not yet
mention, with its default and a comment explaining it, so a new option does not
require knowing that a variable name exists.

It can also **withdraw** one, and that is the only case in which this script
removes a line. When a setting's default changes, installs that received the
old default explicitly would be pinned to it — needing exactly the hand-edit
this mechanism exists to avoid. A line is withdrawn only when it *still matches
the default we wrote* **and** still carries the comment we wrote beside it. An
operator's own line has no such comment and is never touched, so this can
withdraw a suggestion nobody acted on but never reverse a decision.

The rules that make all of this safe against a file holding `DB_PASSWORD`,
`JWT_SECRET` and `ENCRYPTION_KEY`:

- **Append only.** No existing line is rewritten, reordered or removed, so a
  value you chose is never reverted by a later deploy.
- **Set *or* commented out both count as present.** Commenting a setting out is
  an expressed intent; a deploy that silently re-added it would override you.
- **A backup is taken** (`.env.prod.bak-<timestamp>`) before the first write of
  a run, and an unwritable or missing file is skipped with a note rather than
  failing the deploy.
- **Permissions survive.** A withdrawal rewrites the original file in place
  rather than `mv`-ing a temp over it — `mv` would replace the inode and hand
  the file the temp's umask-derived mode, quietly turning a `0600` secrets file
  world-readable.
- **The list is an explicit allowlist in the script, never "every key in
  `.env.prod.example`".** That file ships placeholder secrets
  (`DB_PASSWORD=CHANGE_ME_…`, `ENCRYPTION_KEY=CHANGE_ME_…`); introducing one
  into a working install would lock out the database or make every stored CSD
  and payment credential undecryptable. Only inert settings whose default
  preserves current behaviour belong there.

#### Deploying a commit CI hasn't published yet

### Deploying from the web GUI (optional)

**Settings → Version → Update now**. Nothing to install: `redeploy` puts the
agent's systemd units in place and keeps them current, the same way it applies
migrations. The button appears once the timer has ticked once (≤30s).

Set `VIGABSS_DEPLOY_AGENT=0` in `.env.prod` if you would rather not have a timer
on the box; GUI deploys are then unavailable and the CLI is unaffected. A host
without systemd is skipped automatically.

Put it in **`.env.prod`**, not in front of the command: `sudo` clears the
environment, so `VIGABSS_DEPLOY_AGENT=0 sudo redeploy` is discarded silently —
the same trap that makes the rollback target a positional argument.

The next `sudo redeploy` **stops and disables** an agent that is already
running, rather than merely declining to install one — the units ship with the
deploy, so by the time you set the flag the timer is normally already enabled.
The agent also re-reads the flag on each tick and exits before writing a
heartbeat, so the button disappears from the GUI even before you redeploy.
`0`, `false`, `no` and `off` all mean off (any capitalisation); anything else is
**warned about and treated as on**, because a typo must never leave you
believing a root-privileged path is disabled when it is not.

Until the timer has run, the panel says so rather than showing a button that
would fail — a request is never queued for something that will not service it.

#### Why an agent instead of just letting the app do it

The obvious implementation mounts the Docker socket into the app container.
**That is root on the host**: any RCE or path traversal in VigaBSS would own the
machine rather than the application. Nothing about a convenience button is worth
that, so the privilege lives outside the container instead.

| | can do |
|---|---|
| app container | `INSERT` one row into `deploy_requests` |
| host agent (root, outside Docker) | run `redeploy.sh`, with **no arguments** |

**The request carries no target.** There is deliberately no commit, tag or image
column: a request that could name what to deploy would hand a compromised app an
arbitrary-image-deploy primitive — most of what the socket would have given
away. The agent always deploys whatever CI published for current `main`.

So the worst case, with the application **fully compromised**, is: an attacker
can trigger a redeploy of the signed image that was going to be deployed
anyway. Compare that with handing out root.

#### Operational notes

- The timer polls every 30s, so that is the worst-case delay before a deploy
  starts.
- Overlap is prevented twice over: `Type=oneshot` will not start a second
  instance, and the agent claims work with an `UPDATE ... WHERE status =
  'pending'` rather than select-then-update.
- A deploy that never reports back is marked failed after an hour rather than
  retried forever.
- The agent authenticates to MySQL with the `MYSQL_USER`/`MYSQL_PASSWORD` that
  compose already injected into the database container — the same parse of
  `.env.prod` the running stack uses, so any file format that works for the app
  works for the agent. It has no API token and opens no port.
- Nothing sensitive reaches the argv of a **host** process: `/proc/<pid>/cmdline`
  is world-readable, so a local account could otherwise poll for the argv of the
  root agent. The password is passed as `MYSQL_PWD` and expanded inside the
  container; the SQL goes in on **stdin** (an `exec -e SQL_STMT=…` form was
  tried and rejected — it lands in host argv, carrying `output_tail`).
- A failing query is reported to the journal **classified, never verbatim**:
  compose is invoked with `--env-file .env.prod` and its parser quotes the
  offending line back on a parse error, which would otherwise print secrets into
  the journal every 30 seconds.
- Rolling back is still CLI-only and deliberately so: `sudo redeploy <sha>`.
  Rollback needs a target, and a target is exactly what this path must never
  accept.

#### Update notification

On by default. The install operator gets a once-a-day banner and a
**Settings → Version** tab when a newer `main` build exists, with no
configuration on a fresh install. The installed semantic release and exact
image commit are displayed separately.

This is the only outbound request VigaBSS makes on its own behalf: an
unauthenticated read of the newest commit on the public repo. No install data,
no version and no identifiers are sent. On an air-gapped or isolated management
network, switch it off:

```bash
VIGABSS_UPDATE_CHECK=0
```

An unrecognised value is read as the default rather than as "off", so a typo
cannot silently disable it.

The most common "failure" is not one: you merge, immediately run `sudo
redeploy`, and the image does not exist yet because CI publishes only *after*
the security scan passes — several minutes later. `redeploy` **retries the
pull** until it succeeds, up to `VIGABSS_IMAGE_WAIT` seconds (default `600`,
`0` disables):

```bash
VIGABSS_IMAGE_WAIT=1800 sudo -E redeploy    # note -E: sudo strips the variable otherwise
```

It retries the real pull rather than probing first, because **GHCR answers
`401 unauthorized` for a tag that does not exist**, not `404`. A not-yet-built
image is therefore indistinguishable by message from a private package, and
any logic keyed on that wording skips the wait exactly when it is needed. Only
two conditions fail fast, because waiting cannot fix them: an architecture
mismatch, and a full disk.

That same GHCR quirk is why the failure message lists *both* causes in
likelihood order instead of asserting one.

If the pull then fails, nothing on the host has changed and the previous
containers are still serving. The script names the **one** cause that applies
rather than listing all of them:

- **`manifest unknown`** — no image for that commit. Usually CI still running.
  But note the `container-scan` job is deliberately allowed to go **green
  without building** when Docker Hub is unreachable, so on older commits a
  green tick is not proof an image exists — open the run and look for
  "Container scan SKIPPED". (Since this change, that case fails the branch on
  `main` rather than passing quietly.)
- **`denied` / `unauthorized`** — see the one-time package-visibility step below.
- **`no matching manifest`** — the image exists but not for this machine's
  architecture. Published builds are `linux/amd64` and `linux/arm64`; anything
  else builds from source.

##### Upgrading from a build-on-the-server install

If `/usr/local/bin/redeploy` is a **copy** of the old script (the pre-wrapper
install form), it is still what runs after `git pull` — replace it with the
wrapper shown above, then deploy:

```bash
git -C /opt/vigabss pull
sudo tee /usr/local/bin/redeploy >/dev/null <<'EOF'
#!/usr/bin/env bash
exec env VIGABSS_DIR=/opt/vigabss /opt/vigabss/redeploy.sh "$@"
EOF
sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/redeploy
sudo redeploy
```

Skipping that is not harmless: the old script runs `up -d --build`, finds no
`build:` block for `app`, and falls back to `${VIGABSS_IMAGE:-…:latest}`. If CI
has not yet published the commit you just pulled, `:latest` is still the
*previous* one — so it succeeds while deploying older code against a newer
source tree.

##### Architecture

The image is published for **linux/amd64 and linux/arm64**, so Ampere, Graviton
and Hetzner CAX boxes pull it like anything else — `docker` picks the right one
automatically. CI builds each on a native runner rather than emulating arm64,
and `:latest` / `:<sha>` are only created once *both* have been built and
scanned, so a failure on one architecture never leaves the tag everyone pulls
pointing at a half-finished release.

Anything more exotic (32-bit ARM, RISC-V) has no published image; `install.sh`
detects that and builds from source instead.

##### One-time: make the image pullable

**A GitHub Container Registry package is PRIVATE by default, even when the
source repository is public.** The first CI run creates the package; until its
visibility is set, `docker compose pull` on the server fails with
`denied` / `unauthorized` and no amount of re-running will help.

Pick one:

**Public image (simplest).** On GitHub → your profile → **Packages** →
`vigabss` → **Package settings** → **Change visibility** → Public. The
repository is already public and `.dockerignore` excludes `.env*`, so the image
contains nothing the source tree doesn't. Servers then pull anonymously with no
credentials to manage or rotate.

**Private image.** Keep it private and authenticate on each server with a
classic PAT scoped to `read:packages` only:

```bash
echo "$GHCR_PAT" | docker login ghcr.io -u <github-username> --password-stdin
```

Docker stores that in `/root/.docker/config.json`, so it survives reboots and
`redeploy` needs no change. Remember the PAT's expiry — when it lapses, deploys
start failing at the pull step, which (by design) leaves the running stack
untouched.

#### Verifying what is actually deployed

```bash
COMPOSE="docker compose -f /opt/vigabss/docker-compose.prod.yml --env-file /opt/vigabss/.env.prod"

# Which commit is the running container built from?
$COMPOSE images app

# The hashed bundle name changes whenever the frontend really changed.
curl -s https://<DOMAIN>/ | grep -o 'index-[^"]*\.js'
#    (optional) confirm a specific change shipped:
#    curl -s "https://<DOMAIN>/assets/<bundle>.js" | grep -c "<string from your change>"
```

> There is no longer any such thing as a stale cached frontend layer on the
> server, because the server does not build. If a merged change is not visible,
> the question is *which image tag is running* — not whether to force a rebuild.
> `--no-cache` is not the answer and no longer appears in these docs.

#### Building on the host anyway

Air-gapped, or testing an unmerged commit? Layer on the build override:

```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml -f docker-compose.build.yml --env-file .env.prod up -d --build
```

Do that on a machine with headroom. `FRONTEND_BUILD_HEAP_MB` (default 2048)
bounds V8's old space during the build so an oversized typecheck fails as a
clean heap OOM instead of taking the host down with it.

## The install operator

Some things belong to the deployment rather than to any tenant: where the
install's infrastructure alerts go (`ops_alert_email`), which tile server every
map loads, poller nodes, and the update/deploy controls. Only the **install
operator** can change them.

The operator is an explicit fact on the account, `users.is_install_operator`
(migration 444) — **not** a role. `users.role='admin'` cannot express it,
because that is the per-organisation Admin persona: on a multi-tenant install
every tenant has one, so gating on it would hand every tenant admin the deploy
button.

**You do not normally have to do anything.** A fresh install seeds the flag onto
the admin account it creates. Upgrading an existing install grants it to every
active admin when the install has one organisation, and to the oldest active
admin when it has more.

### Changing who the operator is

Set the environment variable — user **IDs**, comma-separated — and restart:

```env
# /opt/vigabss/.env.prod
INSTALL_OPERATOR_USER_IDS=1
```

When set, it overrides the stored flag completely. IDs rather than email
addresses on purpose: an email is editable from inside the application, so an
email allowlist would be writable by the accounts it is meant to exclude.

Find the id under **Admin → Users**, or:

```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml --env-file .env.prod exec -T db-primary \
  sh -c 'MYSQL_PWD="$MYSQL_PASSWORD" exec mysql -u "$MYSQL_USER" "$MYSQL_DATABASE" \
    -e "SELECT id, email, role, is_install_operator FROM users WHERE deleted_at IS NULL;"'
```

To move the flag permanently instead of overriding it, update the column
directly and leave `INSTALL_OPERATOR_USER_IDS` empty. The column is deliberately
not writable through the API, so there is no web UI for it.

### Symptoms of it being on the wrong account

The Settings → Version tab and the update banner disappear, install-wide
settings show as read-only, and `POST /system/deploy` answers 404. That is the
gate refusing you, not a broken install — set `INSTALL_OPERATOR_USER_IDS` and
restart.

## Bare-Metal / VM Deployment

### 1. Install Node.js

```bash
curl -fsSL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_24.x | sudo -E bash -
sudo apt-get install -y nodejs
sudo corepack enable
```

### 2. Install MySQL 8.4

```bash
sudo apt-get install -y mysql-server
sudo mysql_secure_installation
```

Enable Event Scheduler:

```sql
SET GLOBAL event_scheduler = ON;
```

Add to `/etc/mysql/mysql.conf.d/mysqld.cnf`:

```ini
[mysqld]
event_scheduler = ON
```

### 3. Create Database and User

```sql
CREATE DATABASE vigabss CHARACTER SET utf8mb4 COLLATE utf8mb4_unicode_ci;
CREATE USER 'vigabss'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY '<strong-password>';
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON vigabss.* TO 'vigabss'@'localhost';
FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
```

### 4. Deploy Application

```bash
# Clone or copy the application
cd /opt/vigabss

# Install the pinned workspace dependencies
pnpm install --frozen-lockfile

# Run migrations
pnpm run migrate

# Seed default data (roles, permissions, settings, tax rates)
# Only needed on first install
pnpm run seed

# Start the server
pnpm start
```

### 5. Run as a System Service (systemd)

Create a dedicated account, then create `/etc/systemd/system/vigabss.service`:

```bash
sudo useradd --system --user-group --home-dir /opt/vigabss --shell /usr/sbin/nologin vigabss
sudo chown -R vigabss:vigabss /opt/vigabss
```

```ini
[Unit]

After=network.target mysql.service

[Service]
Type=simple
User=vigabss
WorkingDirectory=/opt/vigabss
EnvironmentFile=/opt/vigabss/.env
ExecStart=/usr/bin/node src/server.js
Restart=on-failure
RestartSec=10

# Security hardening

```

```bash
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl enable vigabss
sudo systemctl start vigabss
sudo journalctl -u vigabss -f  # View logs
```

## Docker Deployment

### Local/source Docker Compose

The default `docker-compose.yml` is the local source stack: it builds the
application image on this machine and reads `.env`. Use the one-line installer
and `docker-compose.prod.yml` for a production host.

```bash
# Configure environment
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with local/development values

# Start services
docker compose up -d

# Run migrations (first time only).
# NOTE: the production image strips npm, so call the script with `node` directly.
docker compose exec app node src/scripts/migrate.js

# Seed defaults (first time only)
docker compose exec app node src/scripts/seed.js

# View logs
docker compose logs -f app
```

### Updating

On an installer-managed production host, use the generated wrapper. It selects
`docker-compose.prod.yml`, pins the image that matches `main`, migrates before
starting listeners, and verifies readiness:

```bash
sudo redeploy
```

For the local/source stack above, rebuild after pulling source changes:

```bash
git pull
docker compose up -d --build
docker compose exec app node src/scripts/migrate.js   # apply any new migrations
```

See **[Updating to a new version](#updating-to-a-new-version)** for why the
production host no longer compiles anything, how to roll back by tag, and how to
verify which image is actually running.

### Custom Dockerfile (production optimized)

The included `Dockerfile` is production-ready:
- Node.js 24 on Debian Bookworm slim
- Non-root user (the image currently retains the legacy internal account name
  `fireisp`; this is not an installation or database name and need not be
  changed on existing volumes)
- Health check built-in
- Production dependencies only

---

## Docker Swarm

For multi-node deployments:

```yaml
# docker-stack.yml
version: '3.8'

services:
  app:
    image: ghcr.io/vothalvino/vigabss:0.1.0-alpha.1

## MySQL Tuning

VigaBSS's SNMP metrics tables can grow to 155M+ rows. Recommended MySQL tuning for production:

```ini
[mysqld]
# InnoDB Buffer Pool — set to 50-70% of available RAM
innodb_buffer_pool_size = 2G

# Event Scheduler (REQUIRED for SNMP rollup + connection_logs)
event_scheduler = ON

# Transaction log
innodb_log_file_size = 256M
innodb_flush_log_at_trx_commit = 2  # 1 for max safety, 2 for performance

# Connection limits
max_connections = 200

# Query performance
innodb_io_capacity = 2000
innodb_io_capacity_max = 4000

# Partition maintenance (for snmp_metrics monthly partitions)
open_files_limit = 65535

# Binary logging for point-in-time recovery
log-bin = mysql-bin
binlog_expire_logs_seconds = 604800  # 7 days
server-id = 1

# Character set
character-set-server = utf8mb4
collation-server = utf8mb4_unicode_ci
```

### SNMP Metrics Scale Reference

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Devices polled | 6,000 |
| Poll interval | 5 minutes |
| Raw rows/day | ~1.73 million |
| Raw retention | 90 days (~155M rows) |
| Monthly partition size | ~52M rows |

## Reverse Proxy (Nginx)

### `/etc/nginx/sites-available/vigabss`

```nginx
upstream vigabss {
    server 127.0.0.1:3000;
    keepalive 32;
}

server {
    listen 443 ssl http2;
    server_name isp.example.com;

    ssl_certificate     /etc/letsencrypt/live/isp.example.com/fullchain.pem;
    ssl_certificate_key /etc/letsencrypt/live/isp.example.com/privkey.pem;

    # Security headers are set by the APP (Helmet, see src/app.js) — do not add
    # them here. nginx `add_header` appends to what the upstream already sent,
    # so repeating them puts two values on every response instead of overriding.

    # SSE support — disable buffering for event streams
    location /api/v1/events/ {
        proxy_pass http://vigabss;
        proxy_http_version 1.1;
        proxy_set_header Connection "";
        proxy_buffering off;
        proxy_cache off;
        proxy_read_timeout 86400s;
    }

    # API and application
    location / {
        proxy_pass http://vigabss;
        proxy_http_version 1.1;
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;

        # File uploads (10MB max)
        client_max_body_size 10m;
    }

    # Metrics endpoint — restrict to internal networks
    location /metrics {
        allow 10.0.0.0/8;
        allow 172.16.0.0/12;
        allow 192.168.0.0/16;
        deny all;
        proxy_pass http://vigabss;
    }
}

server {
    listen 80;
    server_name isp.example.com;
    return 301 https://$host$request_uri;
}
```

---

## TLS / HTTPS

See **[docs/tls-setup.md](./tls-setup.md)** for the full TLS configuration
guide, including:

- **Let's Encrypt (HTTP-01)** — single-domain, automated via the Certbot
  Docker service + `nginx/init-letsencrypt.sh` bootstrap script.
- **Manual / commercial certificate** — drop `fullchain.pem` + `privkey.pem`
  into `./nginx/certs/` and reload nginx.

### Quick start (Let's Encrypt, HTTP-01)

```bash
chmod +x nginx/init-letsencrypt.sh
DOMAIN=isp.example.com EMAIL=admin@example.com ./nginx/init-letsencrypt.sh
docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml --env-file .env.prod up -d
```

This production topology runs the public application as the image's non-root
`fireisp` compatibility account and grants it no Linux capabilities. The optional WireGuard hub is
enabled from the installation-wide web Settings page; a separate hardened helper
owns `NET_ADMIN`. See [WireGuard activation](wireguard-setup.md#1-activation--web-gui).

Certificates renew automatically when within 30 days of expiry; nginx hot-reloads every 6
hours to pick them up.

---

## Admin IP Allowlist

VigaBSS can restrict access to sensitive admin endpoints to a set of trusted
IP addresses and/or CIDR ranges, providing an additional defence-in-depth
layer on top of JWT authentication and RBAC.

### Protected endpoints

Once the allowlist is activated, the following API routes require the client IP
to match the configured list:

| Route | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `/api/v1/organizations` | Organisation configuration |
| `/api/v1/users` | User management |
| `/api/v1/roles` | Role management |
| `/api/v1/settings` | System settings |
| `/api/v1/audit-logs` | Audit trail |
| `/api/v1/scheduled-tasks` | Scheduled task management |
| `/api/v1/import` | Bulk data import |
| `/api/v1/billing` | Billing cycle management |

### Configuration

The recommended flow is in the web GUI: open **Security & Access Control**, add
trusted IPv4 addresses or CIDR blocks as inactive entries, then explicitly
activate an entry. VigaBSS refuses an activation or edit that would exclude the
current browser IP. Deactivating the last active entry disables enforcement.

Until the first entry is activated, the endpoints remain accessible to
authenticated administrators and the install operator sees a persistent setup
warning.

`ADMIN_IP_ALLOWLIST` remains available as an optional installation-wide
override for operators who prefer deployment-managed configuration:

```env
# Allow a private management subnet and a specific jump-box IP
ADMIN_IP_ALLOWLIST=10.0.0.0/8,203.0.113.5

# Allow only a /24 management VLAN
# ADMIN_IP_ALLOWLIST=192.168.100.0/24
```

When `ADMIN_IP_ALLOWLIST` is set, it takes precedence over the database policy.
A configured but entirely invalid environment override fails closed. When it is
empty, the GUI-managed per-organization policy controls enforcement.

### Rejected requests

Requests from unlisted IPs receive:

```json
{
  "error": {
    "code": "FORBIDDEN",
    "message": "Access denied: your IP address is not permitted to access this endpoint"
  }
}
```

### Behind a reverse proxy

If VigaBSS runs behind Nginx (or any other reverse proxy), make sure the
proxy sets `X-Forwarded-For` and that Express trusts the proxy:

```env
# Trust the first upstream proxy (Nginx)
# Set this in your .env if the app is behind a reverse proxy
TRUST_PROXY=1
```

Or call `app.set('trust proxy', 1)` in `src/app.js` when the deployment
topology requires it. Without this, `req.ip` will be the proxy's IP rather
than the real client IP, and the allowlist will not work as expected.

---

## Monitoring

### Health Check

```bash
curl https://isp.example.com/health
# {"status":"ok","version":"0.1.0-alpha.1","uptime":3600,"relay":"standalone","timestamp":"..."}

curl https://isp.example.com/health?detail=true
# Adds memory usage and DB latency
```

### Prometheus Metrics

VigaBSS exposes metrics at `/metrics` in Prometheus exposition format:

```yaml
# prometheus.yml
scrape_configs:
  - job_name: vigabss
    static_configs:
      - targets: ['isp.example.com:3000']
    metrics_path: /metrics
    scrape_interval: 15s
```

Available metrics:
- `process_uptime_seconds` — Process uptime
- `process_resident_memory_bytes` — RSS memory
- `http_requests_total` — Total HTTP requests
- `http_request_errors_total` — HTTP 4xx/5xx errors
- `http_request_duration_seconds` — Request latency histogram

## Kubernetes Deployment

Kubernetes provides automatic scaling, self-healing, and declarative configuration for VigaBSS 0.1.0-alpha.1.

The checked-in raw manifests intentionally retain the `fireisp` namespace,
resource names, selectors, and PVC name. Treat these as stable compatibility
identifiers: changing them during a rebrand can orphan storage or create a
parallel deployment.

### ConfigMap

The maintained [`k8s/configmap.yaml`](../k8s/configmap.yaml) stores non-secret
configuration under the compatibility name `fireisp-config`. Add site-specific
non-secret settings there; database connection values belong in the Secret.

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: fireisp-config
  namespace: fireisp
data:
  NODE_ENV: "production"
  PORT: "3000"
  LOG_LEVEL: "info"
```

### Secret

Edit the maintained [`k8s/secret.yaml`](../k8s/secret.yaml) before applying it.
It uses `stringData`, so values must be plain text rather than pre-encoded.
The `fireisp` database host/name/user defaults are compatibility identifiers;
change them only when the target database was provisioned with different names.

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: fireisp-secret
  namespace: fireisp
type: Opaque
stringData:
  JWT_SECRET: <strong-random-value>
  ENCRYPTION_KEY: <32-byte-hex-value>
  DB_HOST: mysql.fireisp.svc.cluster.local
  DB_PORT: "3306"
  DB_NAME: fireisp
  DB_USER: fireisp
  DB_PASSWORD: <database-password>
```

### Deployment

Use the maintained [`k8s/deployment.yaml`](../k8s/deployment.yaml). It encodes
three security requirements that a minimal copied example tends to lose:

- `strategy: Recreate` drains old writers/listeners before a security migration;
- a pre-start init container migrates the primary and retained isolated schemas;
- the init container and application use the **same immutable release image**.

Before applying, replace `REPLACE_WITH_FULL_COMMIT_SHA` in both image references
with the same 40-character commit SHA published by main CI. Never use `:latest`
for either container: a cached migration image paired with a newer application
image can start code against the wrong schema.

```bash
RELEASE_SHA=<full-40-character-main-commit-sha>
test "${#RELEASE_SHA}" -eq 40
kubectl apply -f k8s/namespace.yaml
kubectl apply -f k8s/configmap.yaml
kubectl apply -f k8s/secret.yaml
kubectl apply -f k8s/pvc.yaml
kubectl apply -f k8s/service.yaml
sed "s/REPLACE_WITH_FULL_COMMIT_SHA/$RELEASE_SHA/g" k8s/deployment.yaml \
  | kubectl apply -f -
kubectl rollout status -n fireisp deployment/fireisp --timeout=180s
```

### Service

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: fireisp
  namespace: fireisp
spec:
  type: ClusterIP
  selector:
    app.kubernetes.io/name: fireisp
    app.kubernetes.io/component: api
  ports:
    - name: http
      port: 80
      targetPort: http
      protocol: TCP
```

### Ingress

```yaml
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  name: fireisp
  namespace: fireisp
  annotations:
    cert-manager.io/cluster-issuer: letsencrypt-prod
    nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/proxy-body-size: "50m"
spec:
  ingressClassName: nginx
  tls:
    - hosts:
        - isp.example.com
      secretName: fireisp-tls
  rules:
    - host: isp.example.com
      http:
        paths:
          - path: /
            pathType: Prefix
            backend:
              service:
                name: fireisp
                port:
                  name: http
```

### PersistentVolumeClaim

The `storage/` directory holds uploaded files and must persist across pod restarts:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
metadata:
  name: fireisp-storage
  namespace: fireisp
spec:
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteMany
  storageClassName: nfs
  resources:
    requests:
      storage: 20Gi
```

> **Note:** Use a `ReadWriteMany` access mode (e.g., NFS or a cloud file share) when running multiple replicas so all pods can access the same storage volume.

### Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA)

```yaml
apiVersion: autoscaling/v2
kind: HorizontalPodAutoscaler
metadata:
  name: fireisp
  namespace: fireisp
spec:
  scaleTargetRef:
    apiVersion: apps/v1
    kind: Deployment
    name: fireisp
  minReplicas: 2
  maxReplicas: 10
  metrics:
    - type: Resource
      resource:
        name: cpu
        target:
          type: Utilization
          averageUtilization: 70
    - type: Resource
      resource:
        name: memory
        target:
          type: Utilization
          averageUtilization: 80
```

> **Tip:** Start with CPU-based scaling and add memory metrics if your workload is memory-intensive. Monitor actual utilization for a few days before tuning thresholds.

---

## Database Replication

For high availability and read scaling, configure MySQL replication.

### Primary-Replica Setup

1. **Primary** handles all writes (INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE) and schema migrations.
2. **Replicas** handle read traffic (SELECT queries for dashboards, reports, SNMP metrics).

On the primary, enable binary logging in `/etc/mysql/mysql.conf.d/mysqld.cnf`:

```ini
[mysqld]
server-id = 1
log_bin = /var/log/mysql/mysql-bin.log
binlog_format = ROW
gtid_mode = ON
enforce_gtid_consistency = ON
```

On each replica:

```ini
[mysqld]
server-id = 2
relay_log = /var/log/mysql/mysql-relay-bin.log
read_only = ON
gtid_mode = ON
enforce_gtid_consistency = ON
```

Start replication on the replica:

```sql
CHANGE REPLICATION SOURCE TO
  SOURCE_HOST='primary.db.example.com',
  SOURCE_USER='repl_user',
  SOURCE_PASSWORD='<replication-password>',
  SOURCE_AUTO_POSITION=1;
START REPLICA;
```

### MySQL Group Replication / InnoDB Cluster

For automatic failover, consider MySQL InnoDB Cluster:

- **MySQL Shell** for cluster administration
- **MySQL Router** for transparent connection routing
- Minimum 3 nodes for fault tolerance

```bash
# Bootstrap MySQL Router to auto-discover the cluster
mysqlrouter --bootstrap root@primary:3306 --directory /etc/mysqlrouter
```

### Connection String Configuration

Configure read replicas in your environment:

```env
# Primary (read-write)
DB_HOST=primary.db.example.com
DB_PORT=3306

# Read replica (optional — used for reporting and dashboards)
DB_READ_HOST=replica.db.example.com
DB_READ_PORT=3306
```

When using MySQL Router:

```env
# MySQL Router ports (read-write and read-only)
DB_HOST=127.0.0.1
DB_PORT=6446
DB_READ_HOST=127.0.0.1
DB_READ_PORT=6447
```

### Event Scheduler

> **Important:** The MySQL Event Scheduler must run on the **primary** node only. Replicas replicate scheduled event results via binlog — do not enable `event_scheduler = ON` on replicas.

```ini
# Primary only
[mysqld]
event_scheduler = ON
```

### Backup Strategy with Replica

Take backups from a replica to avoid impacting production traffic:

```bash
# Full backup from replica using mysqldump
mysqldump -h replica.db.example.com -u backup_user -p \
  --single-transaction --routines --events --triggers \
  vigabss > vigabss_backup_$(date +%Y%m%d).sql

# Or use Percona XtraBackup for large databases. Keep the password in a 0600
# defaults file rather than in argv — /proc/<pid>/cmdline is world-readable, so
# any local account can read the password off a running backup.
cat > /etc/vigabss/backup.cnf <<'EOF'
[xtrabackup]
user=backup_user
password=<password>
EOF
chmod 600 /etc/vigabss/backup.cnf

xtrabackup --defaults-extra-file=/etc/vigabss/backup.cnf \
  --backup --target-dir=/backups/full \
  --host=replica.db.example.com
```

Schedule daily backups via cron:

```bash
0 2 * * * cd /opt/vigabss && docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml --env-file .env.prod exec -T app node src/scripts/backup.js >> /var/log/vigabss-backup.log 2>&1
```

---

## Redis High Availability

Redis is used for session caching, rate limiting, and BullMQ job queues. In production, deploy Redis with high availability.

### Redis Sentinel

Redis Sentinel provides automatic failover with a primary and multiple replicas:

1. Run at least **3 Sentinel instances** for quorum.
2. Sentinels monitor the primary and promote a replica on failure.

Example Sentinel configuration (`sentinel.conf`):

```conf
sentinel monitor vigabss-redis primary.redis.example.com 6379 2
sentinel down-after-milliseconds vigabss-redis 5000
sentinel failover-timeout vigabss-redis 10000
sentinel parallel-syncs vigabss-redis 1
sentinel auth-pass vigabss-redis <redis-password>
```

Configure the application to use Sentinel. With `ioredis` (used by BullMQ), provide Sentinel configuration via environment variables:

```env
REDIS_SENTINELS=sentinel1:26379,sentinel2:26379,sentinel3:26379
REDIS_SENTINEL_NAME=vigabss-redis
REDIS_DB=0
```

If your Redis client library supports a Sentinel URL scheme, the format is:

```env
REDIS_URL=redis+sentinel://sentinel1:26379,sentinel2:26379,sentinel3:26379/vigabss-redis/0
```

> **Note:** The `redis+sentinel://` URL scheme is not universally supported. Check your client library's documentation. `ioredis` uses a structured `sentinels` option rather than a URL string.

### Redis Cluster

For horizontal scaling beyond a single node's memory capacity:

- Data is automatically sharded across multiple masters.
- Each master has one or more replicas for failover.
- Minimum 6 nodes (3 masters + 3 replicas).

```bash
redis-cli --cluster create \
  redis1:6379 redis2:6379 redis3:6379 \
  redis4:6379 redis5:6379 redis6:6379 \
  --cluster-replicas 1
```

### Session and Cache Invalidation

When scaling Redis:

- **Sessions (JWT):** VigaBSS uses stateless JWTs — no server-side session store is required. Token revocation lists (if enabled) are stored in Redis and must be accessible from all app instances.
- **Cache:** Cached data (plan lookups, permission sets) is stored per-key in Redis. All app nodes share the same cache, so invalidation is automatic.
- **BullMQ:** Job queues require a single Redis instance or Sentinel — Redis Cluster is not natively supported by BullMQ. Use a dedicated Redis Sentinel deployment for job queues if you use Redis Cluster for caching.

---

## Load Balancing

Distribute traffic across multiple VigaBSS instances for high availability and throughput.

### Nginx Upstream Configuration

```nginx
upstream vigabss_backend {
    least_conn;
    server 10.0.1.10:3000;
    server 10.0.1.11:3000;
    server 10.0.1.12:3000;
}

server {
    listen 443 ssl http2;
    server_name isp.example.com;

    ssl_certificate     /etc/ssl/certs/vigabss.crt;
    ssl_certificate_key /etc/ssl/private/vigabss.key;

    location / {
        proxy_pass http://vigabss_backend;
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
    }

    # SSE endpoints need long-lived connections
    location /api/v1/events {
        proxy_pass http://vigabss_backend;
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
        proxy_buffering off;
        proxy_cache off;
        proxy_read_timeout 3600s;
        proxy_send_timeout 3600s;
    }
}
```

### Sticky Sessions

Sticky sessions (session affinity) are **not required**. VigaBSS uses stateless JWT authentication — any backend instance can handle any request. Use `least_conn` or `round_robin` balancing for even distribution.

### WebSocket / SSE Considerations

VigaBSS uses **Server-Sent Events (SSE)** for real-time updates:

- SSE connections are long-lived HTTP connections (minutes to hours).
- Configure `proxy_read_timeout` to a high value (e.g., `3600s`) for SSE endpoints.
- Ensure the load balancer does not prematurely close idle connections.
- Set `proxy_buffering off` so events are delivered immediately.

### Health Check Configuration

Configure active health checks in Nginx (requires `nginx-plus` or the open-source `nginx_upstream_check_module`):

```nginx
upstream vigabss_backend {
    least_conn;
    server 10.0.1.10:3000 max_fails=3 fail_timeout=30s;
    server 10.0.1.11:3000 max_fails=3 fail_timeout=30s;
    server 10.0.1.12:3000 max_fails=3 fail_timeout=30s;
}
```

With Nginx open-source, passive health checks are used by default — failed requests trigger `max_fails` and temporarily remove the upstream. For active checks, use the `/health/ready` endpoint in your load balancer or orchestrator.

## Blue-Green Deployment Strategy

Blue-green deployments minimize downtime and risk by running two identical environments.

### Overview

1. **Blue** — the current live environment serving production traffic.
2. **Green** — the new version deployed alongside Blue, not yet receiving traffic.

### Database Migration Compatibility

Migrations must be **forward-only and additive**:

- Add new columns with default values — never remove or rename columns in the same release.
- Add new tables freely.
- Defer destructive changes (column drops, renames) to a follow-up release after the old version is fully retired.

This ensures both Blue and Green can operate against the same database simultaneously.

Run migrations before switching traffic:

```bash
# Deploy Green and run migrations
cd /opt/vigabss-green
pnpm run migrate
```

### Traffic Switching with Nginx

```nginx
upstream vigabss_blue {
    server 10.0.1.10:3000;
    server 10.0.1.11:3000;
}

upstream vigabss_green {
    server 10.0.2.10:3000;
    server 10.0.2.11:3000;
}

server {
    listen 443 ssl http2;
    server_name isp.example.com;

    # Switch traffic: edit this line to point to the desired upstream group
    # (vigabss_blue or vigabss_green), then reload Nginx with:
    #   sudo nginx -t && sudo systemctl reload nginx
    set $backend vigabss_green;

    location / {
        proxy_pass http://$backend;
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
    }
}
```

Reload Nginx to apply:

```bash
sudo nginx -t && sudo systemctl reload nginx
```

### Traffic Switching with Kubernetes

The maintained raw manifests define one Deployment, not a blue-green pair.
Before using selector-based switching, create separate blue and green
Deployments whose pod templates retain the two compatibility labels and add a
third `deployment-track` label. Then switch the Service without dropping its
base selectors:

```bash
kubectl patch service fireisp -n fireisp --type merge -p \
  '{"spec":{"selector":{"app.kubernetes.io/name":"fireisp","app.kubernetes.io/component":"api","deployment-track":"green"}}}'
```

### Rollback Procedure

1. Switch traffic back to Blue (change `$backend` to `vigabss_blue` in Nginx, or update the Kubernetes service selector).
2. Reload the load balancer or apply the selector change.
3. Investigate the issue in the Green environment.
4. If a database migration was applied, deploy a compensating migration — never roll back migrations manually.

### Smoke Test Checklist

Run these checks against the Green environment before switching traffic:

- [ ] `/health/ready` returns `200 OK`
- [ ] Login and JWT issuance works
- [ ] Dashboard loads with correct data
- [ ] Client creation and editing works
- [ ] RADIUS authentication succeeds (test with `radtest`)
- [ ] SNMP polling returns metrics
- [ ] Email notifications send successfully
- [ ] Background jobs (BullMQ) are processing
- [ ] No errors in application logs (`kubectl logs` or `journalctl`)

## Scaling Considerations

### Horizontal Scaling

VigaBSS 0.1.0-alpha.1 is designed as a **stateless application** — any instance can serve any request. Scale horizontally by adding more app server instances behind a load balancer.

Requirements for horizontal scaling:

- **Shared database:** All instances connect to the same MySQL primary.
- **Shared Redis:** All instances connect to the same Redis for cache, rate limiting, and job queues.
- **Shared storage:** The `storage/` directory must be accessible from all instances (use NFS, cloud file storage, or S3-compatible object storage).

### FireRelay Mode

For multi-node deployments, enable **FireRelay** to synchronize real-time events across instances:

```env
FIRERELAY_ENABLED=true
FIRERELAY_TRANSPORT=redis
REDIS_URL=redis://redis.example.com:6379
```

FireRelay uses Redis Pub/Sub to broadcast events (e.g., client disconnections, CoA pushes) to all connected instances, ensuring SSE clients on any node receive updates.

### Database Connection Pool Sizing

Each VigaBSS instance maintains a connection pool to MySQL. Size it based on your instance count and MySQL `max_connections`:

```env
DB_POOL_SIZE=10
```

**Rule of thumb:** `DB_POOL_SIZE × number_of_instances` should not exceed 80% of MySQL's `max_connections`.

```sql
-- Check current MySQL max connections
SHOW VARIABLES LIKE 'max_connections';

-- Example: 3 instances × 10 pool size = 30 connections
-- MySQL max_connections should be at least 40 (30 + headroom)
SET GLOBAL max_connections = 150;
```

### Redis for Session and Cache

When running multiple instances, Redis is required for:

- **Rate limiting:** Shared counters across instances.
- **Cache:** Avoid stale data when one instance invalidates a cache entry.
- **Token revocation:** Revoked JWTs must be checked across all instances.

```env
REDIS_URL=redis://redis.example.com:6379
CACHE_DRIVER=redis
RATE_LIMIT_STORE=redis
```

### Job Queue (BullMQ)

Background tasks (email sending, SNMP polling, invoice generation) are distributed via BullMQ:

- BullMQ uses Redis as its backing store.
- Jobs are automatically distributed — only one instance processes each job.
- Scale workers independently by running dedicated worker processes:

```bash
# Run a dedicated worker process (does not serve HTTP)
node src/workers/index.js
```

Configure concurrency per worker:

```env
BULLMQ_CONCURRENCY=5
```

> **Tip:** For large deployments (10,000+ clients), run separate worker processes dedicated to SNMP polling and invoice generation to avoid blocking lighter tasks like email delivery.

## Helm Chart Deployment

VigaBSS 0.1.0-alpha.1 ships a production-grade Helm chart under `charts/fireisp/` that
templates every Kubernetes resource (Namespace, ConfigMap, Secret, Deployment,
Service, Ingress, HPA, PDB, PVC, PrometheusRule, and ClusterImagePolicy).

> **Compatibility identifier:** the on-disk chart name, chart package,
> template helpers, example release name, namespace, selectors, and PVCs retain
> `fireisp`. They are stable infrastructure identifiers, not the product's
> display name. Renaming them can replace selectors or detach persistent data.

### Prerequisites

- Helm 3.12+
- Kubernetes 1.27+
- MySQL 8.0.29+ (MySQL 8.4 LTS recommended) or MariaDB 10.6+, provisioned
  separately and reachable from the cluster. The chart deploys VigaBSS, not a
  database server. Keep an existing FireISP-era database/user name unchanged;
  create `vigabss` names only for a fresh database.
- (Optional) [cert-manager](https://cert-manager.io/) for TLS
- (Optional) [Prometheus Operator](https://github.com/prometheus-operator/prometheus-operator) for alerting rules
- (Optional) [Sigstore policy-controller](https://github.com/sigstore/policy-controller) for image verification

### Quick Start

```bash
# Add the chart repo (GitHub Pages — populated by chart-releaser CI)
helm repo add fireisp https://vothalvino.github.io/vigabss
helm repo update

# Generate the install values into a file — never pass secrets with --set
umask 077
cat > values-secret.yaml <<EOF
ingress:
  hostname: isp.example.com
secrets:
  JWT_SECRET: "$(openssl rand -base64 48)"
  ENCRYPTION_KEY: "$(openssl rand -hex 32)"
  # Replace with the separately provisioned database service/hostname.
  DB_HOST: mysql.fireisp.svc.cluster.local
  DB_NAME: vigabss
  DB_USER: vigabss
  DB_PASSWORD: my-db-password
EOF
chmod 600 values-secret.yaml

# Install into the fireisp compatibility namespace (creates it automatically)
helm install fireisp fireisp/fireisp \
  --namespace fireisp --create-namespace \
  --version 0.1.0-alpha.1 \
  -f values-secret.yaml
```

> **Production secret management:** `--set` is unsafe for secrets everywhere,
> not just in CI: the value lands in helm's argv, and `/proc/<pid>/cmdline` is
> world-readable, so any local account can read it while the command runs — and
> it is then stored verbatim in the Helm release history. Keep
> `values-secret.yaml` at mode 600 and out of git; beyond a first install, use
> Sealed Secrets or External Secrets Operator —
> see [docs/secrets-management.md](./secrets-management.md).

### Installing from Source

```bash
cd charts/fireisp
helm dependency update          # no external dependencies currently
helm install fireisp . \
  --namespace fireisp --create-namespace \
  --set-string image.tag=<full-40-character-main-commit-sha> \
  -f my-values.yaml
```

### values.yaml Overrides

Create a `my-values.yaml` that overrides only what you need:

```yaml
replicaCount: 3

image:
  repository: ghcr.io/vothalvino/vigabss
  tag: "0.1.0-alpha.1"

ingress:
  hostname: isp.example.com
  tls:
    enabled: true
    clusterIssuer: letsencrypt-prod   # cert-manager ClusterIssuer name

config:
  LOG_LEVEL: "info"
  FEATURE_SSO: "true"

secrets:
  JWT_SECRET: ""          # populated by Sealed Secret / ESO
  ENCRYPTION_KEY: ""
  DB_HOST: mysql-primary.fireisp.svc.cluster.local
  DB_PASSWORD: ""

persistence:
  size: 50Gi
  storageClassName: gp3

monitoring:
  enabled: true           # requires Prometheus Operator CRDs

cosignPolicy:
  enabled: true           # requires sigstore policy-controller CRDs
```

### Running Migrations

The chart's pre-start init container runs migrations automatically, including
retained isolated tenant schemas. Confirm the deployment becomes ready; do not
run a second ad-hoc migration after listeners start:

```bash
kubectl rollout status -n fireisp deployment/fireisp --timeout=180s
```

### Upgrading

```bash
helm upgrade fireisp fireisp/fireisp \
  --namespace fireisp \
  --version 0.1.0-alpha.1 \
  -f my-values.yaml \
  --set-string image.tag=0.1.0-alpha.1
```

### Uninstalling

```bash
helm uninstall fireisp --namespace fireisp
# The PVC is NOT deleted by default (Helm preserves PVCs by default). The
# Secret also has helm.sh/resource-policy: keep — delete both manually if
# doing a full teardown.
kubectl delete pvc -n fireisp fireisp-storage
```

## GitOps with Argo CD

[Argo CD](https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/) can continuously reconcile the
Helm chart against your cluster, giving you automated drift detection and
one-click rollbacks.

### Install Argo CD

```bash
kubectl create namespace argocd
kubectl apply -n argocd \
  -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/argoproj/argo-cd/stable/manifests/install.yaml
```

### Argo CD Application Manifest

Create `gitops/fireisp-app.yaml` and commit it to your GitOps repository:

```yaml
apiVersion: argoproj.io/v1alpha1
kind: Application
metadata:
  name: fireisp
  namespace: argocd
  # Cascade delete: removing this Application also removes the K8s resources.
  finalizers:
    - resources-finalizer.argocd.argoproj.io
spec:
  project: default

  source:
    repoURL: https://github.com/vothalvino/vigabss
    targetRevision: main          # or a tag, e.g. v0.1.0-alpha.1
    path: charts/fireisp
    helm:
      valueFiles:
        - values.yaml
        # Override with environment-specific values committed to the repo:
        - values-production.yaml
      # Fine-grained overrides (avoid plain-text secrets here):
      parameters:
        - name: image.tag
          value: "0.1.0-alpha.1"
        - name: ingress.hostname
          value: isp.example.com
        - name: ingress.tls.enabled
          value: "true"
        - name: ingress.tls.clusterIssuer
          value: letsencrypt-prod
        - name: monitoring.enabled
          value: "true"

  destination:
    server: https://kubernetes.default.svc
    namespace: fireisp

  syncPolicy:
    automated:
      prune: true         # remove resources deleted from the chart
      selfHeal: true      # revert manual kubectl changes
    syncOptions:
      - CreateNamespace=true
      - ServerSideApply=true
    retry:
      limit: 5
      backoff:
        duration: 5s
        factor: 2
        maxDuration: 3m
```

Apply the Application to Argo CD:

```bash
kubectl apply -f gitops/fireisp-app.yaml
# Open the Argo CD UI to watch the sync:
kubectl port-forward svc/argocd-server -n argocd 8080:443
# https://localhost:8080 — default credentials: admin / <initial-password>
argocd admin initial-password -n argocd
```

### Secrets with Argo CD + Sealed Secrets

Combine Argo CD with [Sealed Secrets](https://github.com/bitnami-labs/sealed-secrets)
so encrypted secret manifests can be committed safely to git:

```bash
# Write the values to a 0600 file first — --from-literal would put them in
# kubectl's argv, and /proc/<pid>/cmdline is world-readable to every local
# account on the box.
umask 077
cat > secrets.env <<EOF
JWT_SECRET=$(openssl rand -base64 48)
ENCRYPTION_KEY=$(openssl rand -hex 32)
DB_PASSWORD=my-password
EOF
chmod 600 secrets.env

# Seal the fireisp-secret for the fireisp compatibility namespace
kubectl create secret generic fireisp-secret \
  --namespace fireisp \
  --dry-run=client \
  --from-env-file=./secrets.env \
  -o yaml \
  | kubeseal --format yaml > gitops/fireisp-sealed-secret.yaml

# The sealed manifest is the only copy that should survive
shred -u secrets.env 2>/dev/null || rm -f secrets.env

git add gitops/fireisp-sealed-secret.yaml
git commit -m "chore: rotate VigaBSS secrets"
git push
# Argo CD will automatically apply the SealedSecret and Sealed Secrets
# controller will decrypt it into a regular Secret inside the cluster.
```

See [docs/secrets-management.md](./secrets-management.md) for the full
Sealed Secrets workflow and other secret-backend options (ESO / Vault).

### Chart Release Workflow

The CI pipeline (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) includes a `helm-release` job
that runs on every push of a version tag (`v*.*.*`):

1. Builds and scans both application architectures, then publishes the
   immutable `ghcr.io/vothalvino/vigabss:X.Y.Z` image.
2. Verifies the git tag, chart `version`, and chart `appVersion` are identical.
3. Packages the chart and uploads it to the `gh-pages` branch via
   [`helm/chart-releaser-action`](https://github.com/helm/chart-releaser-action).
4. The updated `index.yaml` is served at
   `https://vothalvino.github.io/vigabss` and is immediately available
   to `helm repo update`.

The chart is never released unless its default image has already been
published successfully.

To cut a new chart release, bump `version` in `charts/fireisp/Chart.yaml`
(and `appVersion` if the app changed) and push a matching git tag:

```bash
git tag v0.1.0-alpha.1
git push origin v0.1.0-alpha.1
```
