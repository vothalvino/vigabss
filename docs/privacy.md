## Data Controller

The data controller is the **ISP operator** who deploys VigaBSS.  VigaBSS is
software — the legal entity responsible for LFPDPPP / GDPR compliance is the
ISP company, not the VigaBSS project itself.

## AI Reply Assistant — prompt-forwarding notice

When the **AI Reply Assistant** is enabled (`ai_policies.enabled = 1`), VigaBSS
constructs a prompt for each inbound support ticket and sends it to the
configured LLM provider.  The prompt includes:

- The ticket subject and description (may contain client-authored PII).
- A network context snapshot (device names, topology path, active outages).
- The relevant section of the operator's phrase library (no client PII).

### PII in prompts

| `redact_pii_before_llm` setting | Behaviour |
|---|---|
| **`1` (default, recommended)** | IP addresses, MAC addresses, phone numbers, email addresses, and postal addresses are replaced with placeholder tokens before the prompt is sent. The original values are rehydrated in the final draft after the LLM responds. **No PII is forwarded to the external provider.** |
| `0` (disabled) | The full ticket text, including any PII the client wrote, is forwarded verbatim to the provider. Use only when the configured provider is an on-prem Ollama instance where data does not leave the server. |

### On-prem option

Configuring an **Ollama** provider (`kind = 'ollama'`, `endpoint_url` pointing
to an internal host) means all LLM inference runs locally.  No prompt data
reaches any external third party regardless of the `redact_pii_before_llm`
setting.

### Operator obligation

Operators must:

1. Disclose the use of AI drafting (and any external LLM provider) in their
   **privacy notice** to subscribers.
2. Sign a **Data Processing Agreement (DPA)** with every external LLM provider
   used (OpenAI, Azure OpenAI, Anthropic, Google).
3. Enable `redact_pii_before_llm = 1` **or** use an on-prem Ollama provider
   when processing data of EU/EEA data subjects under GDPR Art. 44–46.

## Data-Subject Access Request (DSAR) procedure

### LFPDPPP (MX) — *Solicitud de Acceso, Rectificación, Cancelación u Oposición* (ARCO)

1. Data subject submits a written request (email or postal) including:
   - Full name and identification document.
   - Description of the data or processing to which the request refers.

2. Operator has **20 business days** to respond (Art. 24 LFPDPPP).

3. Use the VigaBSS DSAR export tool to generate a JSON of all data held:

   ```bash
   # Via API — admin credential required
   curl -X GET "https://your-fireisp.domain/api/v1/dsar/clients/<client_id>" \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer <admin_token>" \
     -H "X-Org-Id: <org_id>"
   ```

   The response includes: client record, contacts, MX profile, contracts,
   invoices, payments, tickets, connection logs (last 500), IP assignments,
   and AI reply log drafts/finals (last 200, internal prompts excluded).

4. Deliver the JSON export to the data subject (encrypted email or secure download).

5. Log the completed request in the [DSAR log](#dsar-log) below.

### GDPR (EU) — Data Subject Access Request

1. Data subject submits a request (email, web form, or in writing).
   No specific format required. No fee allowed.

2. Operator has **30 calendar days** to respond (GDPR Art. 12).

3. Use the same DSAR export tool as above.

4. If the data subject requests **erasure** (GDPR Art. 17), follow the
   [Erasure procedure](#erasure-procedure) below.

5. Log the completed request in the [DSAR log](#dsar-log) below.

---

## Erasure procedure

### Soft-delete (default)

VigaBSS uses soft-delete (`deleted_at IS NOT NULL`) for clients, contacts,
contracts, invoices, and payments. Soft-deleted rows are invisible to the API
but remain in the database for referential integrity and legal compliance.

### Full erasure (LFPDPPP right to cancellation / GDPR right to erasure)

> **Important:** Some data cannot be erased due to legal obligations:
> - SAT fiscal data (invoices, CFDIs) must be retained **10 years** (CFF Art. 30).
> - IFT network logs must be retained **2 years** (telecoms law).

For erasable data (all other PII), run the following SQL inside a transaction
after confirming no legal retention hold applies:

```sql
START TRANSACTION;

-- 1. Anonymise client PII (preserves row for referential integrity)
UPDATE clients
SET name = '[ERASED]', email = '[ERASED]', phone = NULL, tax_id = NULL,
    address = NULL, city = NULL, state = NULL, zip_code = NULL,
    notes = NULL, deleted_at = NOW()
WHERE id = :client_id;

-- 2. Remove contacts
UPDATE contacts SET name = '[ERASED]', email = NULL, phone = NULL,
    deleted_at = NOW()
WHERE client_id = :client_id;

-- 3. Remove MX profile PII (retain record for CFDI references)
UPDATE client_mx_profiles SET curp = NULL WHERE client_id = :client_id;

-- 4. Anonymise connection logs older than IFT retention window
UPDATE connection_logs
SET ip_address = '0.0.0.0', mac_address = NULL, username = '[ERASED]'
WHERE client_id = :client_id
  AND session_start < DATE_SUB(NOW(), INTERVAL 2 YEAR);

-- 5. Remove ticket free-text (keep record for support SLA stats)
UPDATE tickets SET subject = '[ERASED]', description = '[ERASED]'
WHERE client_id = :client_id;

-- 6. Anonymise AI reply log drafts linked to this client's tickets
--    (draft_text / final_text may reproduce client-authored message content)
UPDATE ai_reply_logs arl
JOIN   tickets t ON t.id = arl.ticket_id
SET    arl.draft_text = '[ERASED]', arl.final_text = '[ERASED]'
WHERE  t.client_id = :client_id;

COMMIT;
```

After running: record the erasure in the [DSAR log](#dsar-log) and
communicate completion to the data subject.

## Retention periods

| Data category | Retention period | Trigger for deletion |
|---|---|---|

## Security measures

- Passwords stored as bcrypt hashes (cost factor 12).
- All API traffic over TLS 1.2+ (Let's Encrypt / Cloudflare).
- Database credentials managed via K8s Sealed Secrets (see `docs/secrets-management.md`).
- Pino logger redacts 62 sensitive field paths before writing logs (see `src/utils/logger.js`).
- `readOnlyRootFilesystem: true`, `capabilities.drop: [ALL]` on K8s pods.
- RBAC — `clients.view` permission required to access any client data.
- IP allowlist available for admin endpoints (`ADMIN_IP_ALLOWLIST`).
- 2FA (TOTP) supported for all operator accounts.
